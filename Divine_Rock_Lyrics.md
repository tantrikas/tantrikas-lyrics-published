# Divine Rock

## Verse 1
You know I feel it in my bones tonight  
Something's calling from deep inside  
Can't explain it but I know it's right  
This feeling that I can't deny  
Been waiting for this moment here  
When everything becomes so clear  

## Pre-Chorus
And you can try to shake me down  
But I'm standing on solid ground  
Yeah, you can try to shake me down  
But I'm standing on solid ground  

## Chorus
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
Built on something that won't decline  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
Written in the stars divine  
No one can take what's truly mine  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  

## Post-Chorus
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Standing strong, standing tall  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Never gonna fall  

## Verse 2
You see me dancing like I own this floor  
Moving like I've never moved before  
There's power flowing through my veins so pure  
Been blessed with something that will endure  
The plan was made before I came  
And nothing's gonna be the same  

## Pre-Chorus
And you can try to shake me down  
But I'm standing on solid ground  
Yeah, you can try to shake me down  
But I'm standing on solid ground  

## Chorus
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
Built on something that won't decline  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
Written in the stars divine  
No one can take what's truly mine  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  

## Post-Chorus
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Standing strong, standing tall  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Never gonna fall  

## Bridge
When the music stops tonight  
(What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine)  
I'll still be burning bright  
(What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine)  
This truth inside won't fade away  
Built to last another day  

*Sax Solo* ðŸŽ·  

## Chorus
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
Built on something that won't decline  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
Written in the stars divine  
No one can take what's truly mine  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  

## Post-Chorus
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Standing strong, standing tall  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Never gonna fall  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) What's mine is mine  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) What's mine is mine  

## Outro
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine  
What's mine is mine, it's mine, it's mine
