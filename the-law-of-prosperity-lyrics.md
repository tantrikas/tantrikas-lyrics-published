# The Law of Prosperity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Law of Prosperity**

\[Intro: long instrumental saxophone house\]

Before I call\
You answer me\
Infinite Spirit\
Open the way\
God is my unfailing supply

God is my supply\
My source, my light\
Every need is met\
Every path is right\
I am rich in faith\
I am rich in grace\
Love and abundance fill this space

I dig my ditches in the desert sand\
Prepare for rain with an open hand\
Though clouds are gone and the wells run dry\
I praise the Lord\
My faith will fly

\[instrumental saxophone house\]

I give thanks\
I receive\
In the right time\
The right way\
I believe\
Abundance flows\
Endlessly\
One with God\
And God with me

I see the good\
And I hold it strong\
Faith is my rhythm\
Love is my song\
Not by sight\
By truth I stand\
Heaven unfolds at my command

There is supply for every demand\
Prosperity flows at Spirit's command\
I act as if it's already done\
For I and the Source are truly one

I give thanks\
I receive\
In the right time\
The right way\
I believe\
Abundance shines\
Eternally\
One with God\
And God with me

\[instrumental saxophone house\]

God is my supply\
I am free\
Infinite Spirit\
Open the way for me\
The fields are ripe\
The harvest complete\
Divine provision beneath my feet

Before you call\
It shall be answered

I fear no shadow\
I doubt no more\
The law of love unlocks every door\
My cup runs over\
My heart can see\
Prosperity flows eternally

All things whatsoever I ask\
Believing\
I receive\
One with God is a majority\
I give thanks that every good\
And perfect gift is mine\
Now\
Faith prepares the way\
Gratitude calls it forth

\[instrumental saxophone house\]

I give thanks\
I receive\
In the right time\
The right way\
I believe\
Blessings rain\
Over me\
One with God\
Eternally

Yes\
God is my supply\
Abundance is my birthright

Om\
Bismillah\
Hallelujah\
Amen\
Namaste\
I am one with the Source\
Forever free\
God is my supply\
And God lives in me

\[outro: instrumental saxophone house\]
