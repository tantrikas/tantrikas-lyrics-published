# The Twelve Lights

In the stillness before the dawn\
The wheel is seen\
Not broken --- but understood

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the dark before knowing, a shadow appears\
Not seeing clearly, the root of our fears\
From not-knowing, intentions are born\
Old patterns repeating, again and again drawn

A spark becomes knowing, awareness ignites\
Mind meeting the world in flickering lights\
Name and form dancing, shape and design\
A body, a story, a yours and a mine

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Six open doorways\
Touching the flame\
The moment of meeting\
Where nothing's the same

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Twelve lights aligned in a single sight\
Each one arising, each one released\
Seeing the chain is the end of the chain\
The wheel turns free when the truth is seen

Twelve lights aligned, no shadow remains\
From cause into cause, now gently untied\
What rises can cease\
What's seen is at peace\
The middle way opens wide

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact gives feeling, pleasant or torn\
Sweetness, the ache, the neutral, the norm\
From feeling comes thirst, a hunger to hold\
Craving for warmth, for stories retold

Grasping and clinging, this must be me\
Becoming a someone, endlessly\
From becoming, a life takes its breath\
And all that is born walks toward death

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But when it is seen\
Not one stands alone\
Each depends on the last\
Like echoes, like tone

No blame, no sin\
No self to defend\
Just causes arising\
And causes that end

In the stillness before the dawn\
The wheel is seen\
Not broken --- but understood

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Twelve lights aligned in awakened sight\
Ignorance fading into clear knowing\
No craving to follow, no self to sustain\
Just movement arising and softly dissolving

Twelve lights aligned --- the wheel stands still\
Not forced, not broken, not denied\
Seen as a whole\
The chain lets go\
And suffering loosens its tie

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With wisdom, formations fall quiet\
With quiet, the mind rests clear\
When craving no longer commands the heart\
No birth, no death appears

What fades is not lost\
What ends was never owned\
Like a flame set free from the wick\
Returning to silence alone

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the way the Buddha saw\
The rising and passing through\
Not a doctrine, not a belief\
But a seeing --- direct and true

Twelve lights, one vision\
No beginning, no end\
Only clarity\
And compassion\
And peace

Amen\
Om\
Namo Buddhāya
