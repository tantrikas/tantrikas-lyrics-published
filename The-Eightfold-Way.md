## ✨ Lyrics

This is that Way  
Bright and pure  

Eightfold steps  
To make freedom sure  

**Right View**  
To see the real as it is  

**Right Intention**  
To act with love, not hiss  

**Right Speech**  
Words that heal, not harm  

**Right Action**  
Gentle hands, calm charm  

**Right Livelihood**  
An honest trade  

**Right Effort**  
Steady, never afraid  

**Right Mindfulness**  
Aware and clear  

**Right Concentration**  
One-pointed, near  

Walk this path  
O hearts awake  

Let the Wheel turn  
For all beings’ sake
