# Love Will Conquer All

---

## Verse 1
The good overcomes the evil  
No matter how hard it tries  
No matter how dark the shadows  
No matter how deep the lies  
It feeds on fear and hatred  
It grows in greed and shame  
But truth stands tall, unbroken  
And love still calls its name  

## Pre-Chorus
Its food is fear, so starve it  
Its breath is hate, deny  
Give it the light of kindness  
And watch the darkness die  

## Chorus
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
Shining through the night  
Breaking every wall  
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
With truth as our light  
Love will conquer all  

## Verse 2
It hides in false pretenders  
It thrives on cruel disguise  
But love unmasks the shadows  
And truth exposes lies  
Good people, stand together  
One voice, one heart, one flame  
We’ll take away its power  
And call it by its name  

## Pre-Chorus
Its food is fear, so starve it  
Its breath is hate, deny  
Give it the light of kindness  
And watch the darkness die  

## Chorus
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
Shining through the night  
Breaking every wall  
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
With truth as our light  
Love will conquer all  

## Meditative Breakdown – Spoken/Chanted
_No matter how hard…_  
_No matter how difficult…_  
_No matter how shameful…_  
_No matter how devious…_  
_No matter how demeaning…_  
_No matter how cunning…_  
_No matter how deceitful…_  
_No matter how devilish…_  
**The good will overcome…**  
**The light will overcome…**  
> _(Echoing voices: “Overcome… overcome…”)_  
Truth cannot leave, lies cannot stay…  
The real cannot leave, the fake fades away…  
Love is the light, the light in the dark…  
Kindness the fire, igniting the spark…  

## Bridge
When it turns to hate — we answer with love  
When it hides in lies — truth shines above  
When it tries to break — we stand as one  
In the light of love, the war is won  

## Final Chorus – Extended
Love will conquer all (oh, love will conquer all)  
Love will conquer all (every heart will hear the call)  
With truth as our light,  
We’ll shatter the night  
Love will conquer all  
Yes, love will conquer all  

**_(Outro – whispered chant fading)_**  
_Love… will conquer… all…_
