# LET GOD

I’ve carried burdens  
Tried to run the show  
Fighting battles  
I was never meant to hold  
Then I heard the silence  
Whisper soft and low  
You don’t have to do this  
Just let it go  

---

So I’m dropping every chain  
Drop it, drop it  
Laying down my pain  
Give it up, give it up  
Hands up high  
I’m free at last  
Grace has found me  
No more looking back  

---

LET GO AND LET GOD  
DO WHAT HE DO  
Oh yeah  
He moves mountains  
Watch Him see you through  

No more worry  
No more fear  
Every step is guided here  
Just let go  
And watch Him appear  

---

Dreams I thought were gone  
Breathing life  
Storms that tried to break me  
Lost their fight  
Now I’m dancing where  
I used to cry  
’Cause the power works  
When I stop trying  

Dreams I thought were gone  
Breathing life  
Storms that tried to break me  
Lost their fight  
Now I’m dancing where  
I used to cry  
’Cause the power works  
When I stop tryin’  

---

LET GO AND LET GOD  
DO WHAT HE DO  
Oh yeah  
He moves mountains  
Watch Him see you through  

No more worry  
No more fear  
Every step is guided here  
Just let go  
You’re watched again  
You’re held again  

---

Ayy, I used to stress  
Tryna’ write the script  
Like I’m the author  
Nah, I had to quit  
The voice within said  
Sit back, breathe, let move  
Every closed door  
Had another way through  

Anxiety loud  
But my trust louder  
Fear in my ear  
I just drown it out, yeah  
You can keep the weight  
I’m dropping mine  
Provision’s already working  
Right on time  

---

From the shadows to the light  
That’s the story  
Hands off the wheel  
Now life gets the glory  
So if you’re tired of the fight  
Take a breath and then  
LET. GO. AND. DRIFT. AWAY  
Ayy

LET GO AND LET GOD  
DO WHAT HE DO  
It’s already moving  
It’s coming through  
Victory is waiting  
In store for you  
Wave goodbye to old despair  
Miracles are in the air  
Just let go  
And leave it there  

LET GO AND LET GOD  
DO WHAT HE DO  
It’s already moving  
It’s coming through  
Victory is waiting  
In store for you  
Wave goodbye to old despair  
Miracles are in the air  
Just let go  
And leave it there  

LET GO AND LET GOD  
DO WHAT HE DO  
It’s already moving  
It’s coming through  
Victory is waiting  
In store for you  
Wave goodbye to old despair  
Miracles are in the air  
Just let go  
And leave it there
