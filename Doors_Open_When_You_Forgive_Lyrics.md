# Doors Open When You Forgive

## Verse 1
Felt you leaning back  
Didn't blink or call  
Another wall up  
Me, I saw it all  

## Verse 2
Glass in my hands  
Old ache just sits  
Press on the latch  
Let a little in  

## Pre-chorus
(ahh, mmm)  
There's a weight on my arms, but itâ€™s less than before  
(ahh, mmm)  
Was I holding you out, or just holding on?  

## Chorus
Whatâ€™s keeping these hinges tight?  
Whyâ€™s it easy tonight?  
Are these gates still heavy for you?  

## Post-chorus
Mmm, ahhh, mmm *(with horns)*  
Sliding open wide, sliding open wide  

## Verse 3
Words I never spoke  
Buttons never pressed  
Laughed at a memory  
Didnâ€™t feel so tense  

## Verse 4
Caught somewhere warm  
Right here, right now  
You take a small step  
I donâ€™t know how  

## Pre-chorus
(ahh, mmm)  
Arms feel lighter, breathâ€™s running slow  
(ahh, mmm)  
You watching me let it all go  

## Chorus
Whatâ€™s keeping these hinges tight?  
Whyâ€™s it easy tonight?  
Are these gates still heavy for you?  

## Solo
*Saxophone and horns, gentle vocalization*

## Bridge
(You say) "Push a little more!" **[horn stabs]**  
(I say) "No need, they swing themselves, ohhh"  

## Chorus
Whatâ€™s keeping these hinges tight?  
Whyâ€™s it easy tonight?  
Are these gates still heavy for you?  

## Post-chorus
*(instrumental fade)*
