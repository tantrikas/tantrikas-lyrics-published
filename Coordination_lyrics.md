# Coordination

### Opening Mantra (Soprano, floating)
> "The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."

### Verse 1
Most people resist every precious situation.  
They resist lack with fierce hearts,  
they resist disease with trembling faith,  
they resist disappointment with closed eyes,  
and by resisting these sacred things,  
they actually invite them to remain steadfast.

### Mantra Refrain (call-and-response)
**Yield and live,**  
**resist and suffer.**  
**Yield and live,**  
**resist and suffer.**

### Verse 2 (meditative, over low drone)
When the current of life seems harsh,  
step aside and let the river pass.  
The rock that yields to water  
is never broken,  
but the one that resists  
is worn down through endless time.

### Bridge (Round-style, with rising intensity)
The law of nonresistance  
can be tested in small, gentle ways.  
can be tested in small, gentle ways.  
can be tested in small, gentle ways.

### Bridge 2 (Layered voices, subtle rhythm)
Nonresistance is not weakness,  
it is the highest strength.  
To flow is to know the greater plan,  
to yield is to discover hidden freedom.

### Mantra Refrain (Echoed softly, building layers)
**Yield and live,**  
**resist and suffer.**  
**Yield and live,**  
**resist and suffer.**

### Contemplative Verse
When doors are closed,  
wait in silence.  
Another door is opening,  
one you did not imagine.  
By yielding to the moment,  
you are guided to the eternal.

### Turning Point (Sacred silence â†’ harp, with grace)
If you are criticized deeply,  
do not retaliate with thunder,  
and the criticism will dissolve like morning mist.

### Second Turning Point (Pause â†’ gentle percussion)
If anger is hurled against you,  
do not kindle fire with fire.  
Let the flames dissolve into light,  
and peace will remain as your shield.

### Opening Mantra Reprise (Choir layering, rising)
"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."  
"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."

### Final Liberation (Choir, expansive and soaring)
Remember always,  
the wind of the Holy Spirit  
is forever blowing strong,  
but you must hoist your sail toward heaven.

### Choral Reprise (Echoing the final liberation, but longer)
The breath of God is ceaseless,  
the tide of Spirit unending.  
Lift your heart as a vessel,  
and you shall sail with the Infinite.  
Remember always:  
the law of nonresistance  
is the hidden gate of freedom.

### Closing Mantra (Soft fade, soprano + whispers)
"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."
