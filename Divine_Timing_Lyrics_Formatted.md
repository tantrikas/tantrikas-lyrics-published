# Divine Timing

## Verse 1 *(Liquid Confidence)*  
I allow myself... (mmm)  
To believe... (yeah...)  
These stacks keep callinâ€™ me... (they keep callinâ€™...)  
Like my name in cursive on a penthouse deed...  
Divine timing moves slow... but it moves for me...

## Pre-Chorus *(Sensual Swagger)*  
Ainâ€™t no rush... (no...)  
When the universe... (oh-oh...)  
Puts her hands on my waist...  
And whispers... "Baby, take your place..."

## Chorus *(Lush & Luxurious)*  
ðŸ’° *I am worthy...* (so worthy...)  
ðŸ’° *Of silk sheets and Swiss accounts...* (say it louder...)  
ðŸ’° *Every check got my DNA...*  
ðŸ’° *Signed in Godâ€™s handwriting...* (ohhh... yes...)

## Verse 2 *(Moonlight Economics)*  
Six zeros where the comma go... (cha-ching)  
But my worth ainâ€™t a number... itâ€™s a golden glow...  
They ask "How?" I just smile slow... (mmm-hmm)  
"Manifest with your clothes off..." (let it breathe...)

## Bridge *(The Revelation)*  
*(Ad-libs: Oh-oh-oh... drippinâ€™ in anointed... yeah...)*  
This wealth?  
Itâ€™s just love... liquefied...  
Poolside with the stars up in my eyes...  
The more I spend... the more multiplies... (oh-oh-oh!)

## Chorus *(Reprise â€“ Gospel Trap Remix)*  
ðŸ’° *I am worthy...* (choir hums underneath)  
ðŸ’° *Of silk sheets and Swiss accounts...* (money moans...)  
ðŸ’° *Every check got my DNA...*  
ðŸ’° *Signed in Godâ€™s handwriting...* (drop the beat...)

## Outro *(The Afterglow)*  
*(Whispered over a fading trumpet solo:)*  
"Reciprocate... vibrate...  
Let it circulate...  
Now rotate... my hips...  
And my assets... align..."
