## Verse 1
The crowd is moving, my heart opens wide  
I feel God's spirit moving deep inside  
Each step I take, I know I'm never alone  
God is here with me, making His presence known  
He set my path and now I'm ready to go  
His love's like a river and I let it flow  
On a foundation that will never shake  
I'm dancing in freedom no one can take  

---

## Chorus
What is mine by divine right, can't be taken away  
God's perfect plan for me is built upon a rock, here to stay  
Joy fills my soul as I praise Him every day  
No one can steal what God gave me - it's mine, come what may  

---

## Verse 2
The music is pumping, my hands lifted high  
I shout out His name, sending praise to the sky  
Every blessing I have comes straight from above  
I'm dancing in victory, covered in love  
I'm not gonna worry, won't fear anymore  
What God has declared for me is mine forevermore  

---

## Chorus
What is mine by divine right, can't be taken away  
God's perfect plan for me is built upon a rock, here to stay  
Joy fills my soul as I praise Him every day  
No one can steal what God gave me - it's mine, come what may  

---

## Bridge
My future is bright 'cause I'm held in His grace  
This joy God has given me, the world can't erase  
On unshakable rock I will stand and proclaim  
Love unstoppable - I'm praising His name!  

---

## Chorus
What is mine by divine right, can't be taken away  
God's perfect plan for me is built upon a rock, here to stay  
Joy fills my soul as I praise Him every day  
No one can steal what God gave me - it's mine, come what may
