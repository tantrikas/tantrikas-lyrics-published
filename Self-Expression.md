Lyrics
Lyric Sheet (Verbatim, Annotated):

Verse 1 (Intimate declaration):
Every man has his own place
in the divine plan,
and when he is in his rightful place,
 he will be happy and prosperous.
---
Verse 2 (Choral affirmation):
To be in your rightful place means
to be doing what you love to do
and divinely equipped to do.
 It means that the supply is equal to the demand.

Climax (Key change + fanfare):
It means that you are in harmony
with the cosmic energy,
 and the tide of well-being 
is flowing toward you.

It means that you are expressing
the truth about yourself,
Choir: The truth! The truth!
Soloist: and the truth is that you are a child of God,
Choir: "A child of God!"

Finale (Ecstatic repetition):
"endowed with His power and creativity."
(x3, with ascending melody)
