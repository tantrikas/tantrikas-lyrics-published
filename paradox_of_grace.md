# Paradox of Grace

---

### Spoken Intro  
I call on forgiveness, even for what I canâ€™t recall.  
Freedom settled on my shouldersâ€”soft, sudden, quiet.

---

### Verse 1  
That old pain in my pocket, heavy and hidden,  
Regret like a quiet ache under my skin,  
I carried it everywhere, tucked behind my laughter,  
Hoping you wouldnâ€™t notice, hoping I could forget.

---

### Pre-Chorus  
But you saw the weight I dragged,  
You saw the lines in my hands.  
Every wrong turn, brushed gently asideâ€”  
I heard you say, "Child, thereâ€™s nothing left to hide."

---

### Chorus  
**Your mercy makes me new**  
**Your mercy makes me new**  
**Every broken piece I bring to youâ€”**  
**Mercy makes me, mercy makes me new.**

---

### Verse 2  
No judgment in your eyes, just sunlight and open doors,  
Yesterday fell away like dust in the light.  
You never counted the times I folded in on myself,  
Just took my empty hands and filled them with grace.

---

### Solo  
*Saxophone*

---

### Bridge  
Let the violins rise, let the horns carry my sorrow,  
I lay it all downâ€”these mistakes canâ€™t follow,  
If Iâ€™m under grace, Iâ€™m not under fear,  
Mercy sings over me, soft and clear.

---

### Chorus  
**Your mercy makes me new**  
**Your mercy makes me new**  
**Every broken piece I bring to youâ€”**  
**Mercy makes me, mercy makes me new**  
*(Oh, your mercy makes me new)*

---

### Post-Chorus  
Iâ€™m free now, Iâ€™m freeâ€”  
Mercy makes me new.
