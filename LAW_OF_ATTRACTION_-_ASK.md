# LAW OF ATTRACTION – ASK

There are three steps to manifesting  
Simple  
Eternal  
Unchanging  

---

**Ask**  
**Believe**  
**Receive**  

**Ask**  
**Believe**  
**Receive**  

---

The universe listens before I speak  
It responds before I see  
Every thought is already known  
Every feeling is already felt  

---

This is not about effort  
This is about alignment  
This is not about force  
This is about allowing  

---

I am safe here  
I am present now  
I allow this moment  

---

I ask with clarity  
I ask with openness  
I ask without needing to explain  

---

I do not beg  
I do not plead  
I simply state what feels true to me  

---

The asking is natural  
Like breathing in  
Like naming a feeling  
Like choosing a direction  

---

I ask because desire exists  
And desire exists because life is moving through me  

---

It is natural to ask  
My desire is valid  
I allow myself to want  

---

**Ask**  
**Ask**  
**Ask**
