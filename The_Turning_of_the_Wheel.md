# The Turning of the Wheel

And when the words  
Were spoken  
The heavens trembled  
The silence broken  

Earth and sky  
Rejoiced as one  
For the Wheel of  
Dhamma had been spun  

The devas sang in  
A thousand tongues  
The Blessed One  
Has begun  

At Sarnath’s plain  
The truth was said  
The path to life  
Beyond the dead  

No power of god  
Or demon dire  
Can halt this Wheel  
Or still its fire  

And in the heart  
Of Kondañña bright  
The dawn of truth  
Arose that night  

He saw with wisdom  
Clear and wide  
All things that arise  
Shall also subside
