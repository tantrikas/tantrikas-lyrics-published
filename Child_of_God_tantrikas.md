# 🎵 Child of God

## 🌟 Lyrics

Every man has his own place  
In the divine plan  
And when he is in his rightful place  
He will be happy and prosperous  

To be in your rightful place means  
To be doing what you love to do  
And divinely equipped to do  
It means that the supply is equal  
To the demand  

It means that you are in harmony  
With the cosmic energy  
And the tide of well-being  
Is flowing toward you  

It means that you are expressing  
The truth about yourself  
The truth!  
The truth!  
And the truth is  
That you are a child of God  
A child of God!  

It means that you are in harmony  
With the cosmic energy  
And the tide of well-being  
Is flowing toward you  

It means that you are expressing  
The truth about yourself  
The truth!  
The truth!  
And the truth is  
That you are a child of God  
A child of God!
