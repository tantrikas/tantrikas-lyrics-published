# The Game

## Verse 1  
*intro: instrumental, saxophone house*  

"Most people consider life a battle,  
/ but it is not a battle,  
it is a game.  
/ It is a game,  
however, which cannot be played successfully  
/ without the knowledge of spiritual law..."  

**Game, Law; Game, Law  
Game, Law; Game, Law**  

the old and the New Testaments  
give the rules of the game  
with wonderful clrearness...  

"what you gives, you will receive."  

---

## Verse 2  
"Jesus Christ taught that  
it was a great game of  
Giving and Receiving."  

"Whatsoever a man soweth  
that shall he also reap."  

**Soweth... reap...  
Soweth... reap...**  

"This means that whatever man  
sends out in word or  
deed, will return to him;"  

"what he gives, he will receive."  

---

## Verse 3  
if he gives hate,  
he will receive hate;  
if he gives love,  
he will receive love;  
if he gives criticism,  
he will receive criticism;  
if he lies,  
he will be lied to;  
if he cheats,  
he will be cheated.  

**Give and receive... sow and reap...  
Circle complete... circle complete.**  

---

## Verse 4  
we are thought also,  
that the imaging faculty plays  
a leading part in the  
game of life.  

this means that what man images,  
sooner or later externalises  
in his affairs.  

to play successfully  
the game of life,  
we must train the imaging faculty.  

---

## Verse 5  
A person with an imaging faculty  
trained to image only good,  
brings into his life  
"every rightous desire of his heart"...  

health, wealth, love, friends,  
perfect self expression,  
his highest ideals.  

**Game, Law; Game, Law.  
Sow and reap, give and receive.  
Image the good, and it shall be.  
Game of Life, set spirit free.**  

*outro: instrumental, saxophone*
