# I Am Rich_Mellow Mix

### [Intro – Spoken/Whispered over a soft ambient pad]
*“I am rich… I feel rich… Wealth flows to me…”*

---

### [Verse 1]  
I open up my heart, I open up my mind  
Abundance is my essence, there’s more than enough to find  
Every thought a seed of gold, every breath a gift divine  
I’m calling in the riches, I let my spirit shine  

---

### [Pre‑Chorus]  
My focus is a beacon, drawing fortune close to me  
I’m tuning in to limitless prosperity  

---

### [Chorus (with rising instrumentation)]  
**I am rich, I feel rich**  
My soul aligned, my heart uplifted  
Money and riches, I start to accumulate  
Wealth speeds up, it resonates  
**I am rich, I feel rich**  
My thoughts in flow, my life unlimited  
Simply focusing on being rich  
And I become it, I become it  

---

### [Verse 2]  
I see the doors swing open, I see the pathways clear  
Every opportunity, every blessing I revere  
Gratitude in every moment, gratitude sets me free  
I claim success and plenty, I welcome my victory  

---

### [Pre‑Chorus]  
My focus is a magnet, pulling abundance near  
I trust the law of giving—receiving without fear

### [Chorus (with fuller drums & bass)]  
**I am rich, I feel rich**  
My soul aligned, my heart uplifted  
Money and riches, I start to accumulate  
Wealth speeds up, it resonates  
**I am rich, I feel rich**  
My thoughts in flow, my life unlimited  
Simply focusing on being rich  
And I become it, I become it

### [Bridge – stripped‑back, mantra style over minimal beat]  
**Om… abundant universe, hear my call**  
**Namaste to riches, I welcome them all**  
**Hallelujah to blessings, hallelujah to grace**  
**I stand in my power, I stand in this place**

My soul aligned, my heart uplifted  
Money and riches, I start to accumulate  
Wealth speeds up, it resonates

My thoughts in flow, my life unlimited  
Simply focusing on being rich  
And I become it, I become it
