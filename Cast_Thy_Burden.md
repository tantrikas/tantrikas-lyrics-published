# Cast Thy Burden

## Opening (soft, spoken or whispered)
Cast thy burden… upon the Lord…  
The battle is His… not ours…  

## Verse 1
I carried the weight of sorrow,  
A stone upon my chest.  
The night was filled with shadows,  
No place to find my rest.  
But a voice within the silence,  
Called me to let go,  
“Give Me all your burdens,  
And watch salvation flow.”  

## Chorus (anthemic, repeated)
🎵 The burden is Yours, O Lord,  
The battle is Yours, O Lord.  
I will stand still… I will stand still…  
And see Your salvation, O Lord. 🎵  

## Verse 2
The armies of fear surround me,  
The sea before my eyes.  
My heart begins to tremble,  
I hear the war-drums rise.  
But You whisper in the chaos,  
“Be still, and do not fight.  
The battle belongs to Heaven,  
And I will turn the night.”  

## Chorus (stronger, more layers)
🎵 The burden is Yours, O Lord,  
The battle is Yours, O Lord.  
I will stand still… I will stand still…  
And see Your salvation, O Lord. 🎵  

## Bridge (crescendo / cinematic build)
Stand still… (echo)  
Be not afraid… (echo)  
Lift your eyes, see the dawn break…  
The sea divides, the chains will fall,  
Victory is Yours, Lord of all!  

## Chorus (anthemic, extended)
🎵 The burden is Yours, O Lord… (repeat)  
The battle is Yours, O Lord… (repeat)  
I will stand still, I will stand still…  
And see… see… salvation unfold! 🎵  

## Final Refrain (layered affirmations, meditative fade)
Cast your burden… (echo)  
Lay it down… (echo)  
The battle is His… (echo)  
Stand still… stand still… (echo)  
And see the salvation of the Lord…
