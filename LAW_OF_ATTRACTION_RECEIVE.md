# LAW OF ATTRACTION (RECEIVE)

---

### Lyrics

When there is no attraction  
And no aversion  

When I am not pulling  
And not pushing  

The middle way opens  
Wide and clear  

No urgency  
No delay  
No attachment to outcome  

Belief no longer requires effort  
Because nothing contradicts it  

I allow alignment  
I trust the unseen  
I am already aligned  

In this stillness  
Receiving is natural  

Like gravity  
Like sunrise  
Like breath returning home  

I do not chase  
I do not wait  

I am available  

I am open to receive  
I welcome what matches me  

**Receive**  
**Receive**  
**Receive**  

I ask  
I ask  
I ask  
I ask  

I ask  
And it is heard  

I believe  
Because nothing resists  

I receive  
Because I am aligned  

### Ask · Believe · Receive

Ask  
Believe  
Receive  

Ask  
Believe  
Receive  

It is already done  
I trust the process  
I allow the flow
