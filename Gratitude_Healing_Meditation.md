# Gratitude Healing Meditation

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  
Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  

Thank you for my healing  
I receive it now  
Thank you for my healing  
I allow it now  

Thank you  
Thank you  

Every cell remembers  
How to return to balance  
Every cell responds  
To love and gratitude  

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  

I am grateful  
I am open  
I am aligned  
I am healed  

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  

With every breath  
My body restores  
With every breath  
My energy renews  

Thank you for my healing  
Flowing through me now  
Thank you for my healing  
Here and now  

Thank you, thank you  

Gratitude activates  
The intelligence within me  
Gratitude awakens  
Perfect harmony  

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  
Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  

I release resistance  
I release effort  
Healing happens naturally  
As I give thanks  

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  

Even before I feel it  
Even before I see it  
I am grateful  
And healing responds  

Thank you for my healing  

I am grateful  

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you, thank you  

Thank you for my healing  
Thank you  
Thank you
