# I AM WORTHY

*Affirmation • Abundance • Funk Jazz Soul*

## Lyrics

I allow myself — *mmm*  
To believe — *yeah*  
These stacks keep callin’ me  
They keep callin’  

Like my name in cursive  
On a penthouse deed  
Divine timing moves slow  
But it moves for me  

Ain’t no rush — *no*  
When the universe  
*Oh-oh*  

Puts her hands on my waist  
And whispers  
**Baby, take your place**  

---

### Chorus

**I am worthy**  
So worthy  
Of silk sheets and Swiss accounts  

Say it louder  
Every check got my DNA  
Signed in God’s handwriting  

*Ohhh yes*  

---

Six zeros where the comma go  
But my worth ain’t a number  

It’s a golden glow  
They ask *How*  
I just smile slow  
*Mmm-hmm*  

Manifest with your clothes off  
Let it breathe  

---

### Refrain

It’s just love  
Liquefied  
Poolside with the stars up in my eyes  

The more I spend  
The more multiplies  
*Oh-oh-oh*  

It’s just love  
Liquefied  
Poolside with the stars up in my eyes  

The more I spend  
The more multiplies  
*Oh-oh-oh*  

---

### Outro

**I am worthy**  
Of silk sheets and Swiss accounts  
*Money moans*  

Every check got my DNA  
Signed in God’s handwriting
