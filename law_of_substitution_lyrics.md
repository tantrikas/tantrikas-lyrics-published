# Law of Substitution

## Intro
*Instrumental*

---

## Verse 1
To explain the law of substitution,  
let me tell you a story clear.  
A woman longed for a certain man,  
she loved him, held him dear.  
She asked her guide, “Please speak the word,  
that he may soon be mine.”  
The teacher said, “That breaks the law,  
but I will call the divine design.”  

*Instrumental pause*

**Chorus**  
If he is right, you cannot lose him.  
If he is not, love will find a way.  
The law of substitution,  
brings the right idea to stay.  

*Instrumental pause*

## Verse 2
She saw this man again and again,  
but no headway was made.  
One night she called her teacher and said,  
“His glow has begun to fade.”  
“Perhaps he is not the chosen one,  
another may be right.”  
And soon she met a different man—  
her heart was filled with light.  

*Instrumental pause*

**Chorus**  
If he is right, you cannot lose him.  
If he is not, love will find a way.  
The law of substitution,  
brings the right idea to stay.  

*Instrumental pause*

## Verse 3
This new man spoke the words she dreamed,  
her ideal, her perfect song.  
She said, “It feels uncanny,  
what I’d hoped for all along.”  
She gave her love, forgot the first,  
no loss, no sacrifice.  
The wrong replaced by the right,  
the divine made her choice.  

*Instrumental pause*

## Bridge
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God,  
and all things shall be added unto you.  
The Kingdom is within—  
the realm of right ideas,  
the divine pattern shining through.  

*Instrumental pause*

---

**Chorus**  
If he is right, you cannot lose him.  
If he is not, love will find a way.  
The law of substitution,  
brings the right idea to stay.  

*Instrumental pause*

---

## Outro
By thy words you are justified,  
by thy words you are condemned.  
Speak the word of truth and light,  
and love will never end.  

*Outro: Instrumental*
