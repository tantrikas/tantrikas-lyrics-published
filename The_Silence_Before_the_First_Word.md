# The Silence Before the First Word

In the stillness of the forest  
Beneath the Bodhi’s shade  
He sat, awakened, boundless  
Free of night and day  

The storm of becoming  
Had stilled into peace  
Desire’s long fever had  
Found its release  

In his heart, a question rose  
As soft as wind on stone  
Who could see what I have seen  
Who could know the Unknowable alone  

The truth I found is deep  
Subtle, beyond thought or name  
Would the world of blind eyes  
Even hear this flame  

Then came Brahma Sahampati  
Radiant, bowing low  
Teacher of gods and men  
He whispered  
please let the river flow  

Among beings lost in darkness  
Some have little dust in their eyes  
Teach them, O Compassionate One  
let the Wheel arise  

And the Awakened smiled  
serene and kind  

The ocean of truth moved in his mind  
He rose and  
Walked toward Sarnath’s plain  
Where his five old friends had gathered again
