# The Embrace

## Verse 1
You look at me, soft eyes, I hold my breath  
Both standing silent, pain still between us  
Small words tangle, hands at our sides  
Not sure how to move, but I feel the sun  

## Verse 2
You say my name, real low, and I shiver  
Old hurt like footsteps fading down the hall  
I close my eyesâ€”see us younger, so kind  
We lose the weight, let the heart recall  

## Chorus
Open up, gates swing wide  
All my love, I set free  
I forgive, you forgive me  
Let the gates swing wide  

## Chorus
Open up, gates swing wide  
All my love, I set free  
I forgive, you forgive me  
Let the gates swing wide  

## Bridge
Nothing held back, not tonight  
Arms open wide, honey come inside  
(I forgive, you forgive)  
Let peace settle in, let us begin  

*Solo: Saxophone and horns*

## Chorus
Open up, gates swing wide  
All my love, I set free  
I forgive, you forgive me  
Let the gates swing wide
