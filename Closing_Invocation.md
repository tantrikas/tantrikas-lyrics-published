# Closing Invocation

May the Dhamma’s  
Wheel forever spin  
In every heart  
It may begin  

May craving fade  
May wisdom rise  
May love and truth  
Illumine our eyes  

From Sarnath’s grove  
To every land  
May peace flow forth  
Hand in hand  

For what was spoken  
Beneath the sky  
Still whispers softly  
No one dies  

The self dissolves  
The truth remains  
A silent song  
Beyond all chains  

Turn, O Wheel  
Forever true  
From the Buddha’s heart  
To me, to you
