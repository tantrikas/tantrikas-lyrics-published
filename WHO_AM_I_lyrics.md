# WHO AM I

## Lyrics

Who am I  
Who am I  
Who… am… I  

---

Who am I  
If I am not the body  
Not the flesh, not the bone  
Not the breath that comes and goes  

Not the mind  
Not the thoughts that rise and fall  
Not the stories I was told  
Not the dreams I learned to call my own  

Not the name  
Not the face in the mirror  
Not the past, not the future  
Not the roles I appear in  

Not even the soul  
That calls itself *I*  
Then who  
Or what  
Is this *I*  

---

Who am I  
Who am I  
If I am not these things  
Who am I  

---

If I say I am none of these  
Then I am not  
No thing  
No form  
No fixed identity  

A void  
A no-thing  
A vast nothingness  

---

And if this is the case  
If I am nothing at all  
Then tell me  
Who is asking for answers  
Who is aware of the void  

Who is listening  
Who is watching  
Who remains  
When everything else falls away  

---

Who am I  
Before the question  
Before the thought  
Before the word *I*  

---

Who is this *I*  
Is this *I* the source of all  
The place where all things rise  
The silence before every sound  

And if this is so  
What is this source  
How did it come to be  
From where did it arise  

---

Or is this source  
Unborn… uncaused  
Beginningless  
Endless  

---

**Source-less source**  
Is all that is  
**Source-less source**  
Is all that is  

---

It is the *I*  
That **I Am**  
It is the *I*  
That **I Am**  

---

Not separate  
Not divided  
Not inside  
Not outside  

Not mine  
Not yours  
Not other  
Not many  

---

Who am I  
Must be the same  
As the source-less source  
The one without a second  

---

**I Am**  
**I Am**  

---

I Am the source  
Without a source  
I Am the beginning  
Without beginning  

---

**I Am**  
**I Am**  

---

Who am I  

**I Am**
