# Rich Vibe_Extended

## Lyrics

### Intro
*Funky bass groove*  
**Spoken**  
*hey u up? got smth to tell u...*

### Verse 1
Just checked my bank app on  
Can't believe what I see  
Send u a screenshot quick  
Look what's happening to me ðŸ”¥

### Pre-chorus
Like ur energy pulls me in  
Can't resist this vibe we're in  
Everything I touch turns bright  
Watch it multiply tonight

### Chorus
When u know what ur worth (ayy)  
Let it flow through the earth (ayy)  
Everything comes back to me  
Like a force naturally  
*(Let it flow, let it flow)*

### Verse 2
Got another notification  
Bank app lighting up again  
Think the universe heard me  
When I said "watch this win" ðŸ’«

### Bridge
**(Call & Response)**  
*What u got?* (Abundance!)  
*What u bring?* (That finance!)  
*How u move?* (With power!)  
*What's ur gift?* (This hour!)

### Solo
*Brass section takes over with synth layers*  
*Claps and tambourine build up*

### Chorus
When u know what ur worth (ayy)  
Let it flow through the earth (ayy)  
Everything comes back to me  
Like a force naturally  
*(Let it flow, let it flow)*

### Outro
**Spoken**  
*bro counting blessings*  
*Keep that energy coming thru âœ¨*  
*(Fade out with funk groove)*
