# The Five Heaps We Cling To

---

Then gently he spoke  
In silence deep  
Of the five illusions  
The heart must release  

## First — Form

This body of clay  
Born of dust  
Soon fades away  

Mountains crumble  
Rivers dry  
The mirror shatters  
Yet none die  

For what we call *I*  
Is but a wave  
Rising and falling  
On an empty cave  

## Second — Feeling

Sweet or sore  
Pleasure and pain  
We crave for more  

But each sensation  
Comes and flies  
Like wind on water  
It never stays  

If you chase delight  
You’ll taste its sting  
Release your grasp  
And the heart will sing  

## Third — Perception

Perception’s veil  
The dream we weave  
The tales we hail  
Naming, judging  

Calling real  
Yet all reflections  
On the wheel  

We paint the world  
With thoughts untrue  
And bind ourselves  
By the mind’s own view  

## Fourth — Formations (Mind)

Desire and will  
By karma twined  
All our habits  
Old and new  

Plant the seeds  
Of what we do  
When wisdom sees  
The roots beneath  

The chain is cut  
And the soul finds peace  

## Fifth — Consciousness

Consciousness’ gleam  
The flickering light  
Behind the dream  

It seems to shine  
As “I” or mine  
Yet rises with  
Each sense’s sign  

When clinging ends  
It too will cease  
No loss, no void  
Just boundless peace  

---

Then softly he smiled  
With eyes so clear  
No self to hold  
No self to fear  

All five heaps  
Are but the play  
Of dawn and dusk  
Of night and day  

Let go the wave  
Embrace the sea  
This letting go  
Is liberty
