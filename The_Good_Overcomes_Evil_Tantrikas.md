# The Good Overcomes Evil

No matter how hard  
No matter how difficult  
No matter how shameful  
No matter how devious  
No matter how demeaning  
No matter how cunning  
No matter how deceitful  
No matter how devilish  
No matter how evil  

The enemy of truth is this  
The enemy of kindness is this  
The enemy of love is this  
The enemy of innocent is this  
The enemy of life is this  
The enemy of the divine is this  

This this this Lier  
This this this deceiver  
This this this fake pretender  
This this this evil  
This evil that thrives on lies  
It thrives on its own fear  
It grows in evil capacity  
By creating more lies and more fear  
Its food is fear, it feeds on fear  

What is food for this evil  
Its food is all things that are negative  
For life  
Hate is its food  
Fear of any kind is its food  
Resisting it through fear is its food  
Fighting it through fear is its food  
Greed for power is its food  

How do the good overcome this evil?  
By not feeding this this evil  
The food it needs to grow  
Its food is fear  
So do not give it its nourishment  
Give it the antidote that will  
Extinguish its illusionary power  

Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  

No matter how hard  
No matter how difficult  
No matter how shameful  
No matter how devious  
No matter how demeaning  
No matter how cunning  
No matter how deceitful  
No matter how devilish  
No matter how evil  

How do the good overcome this evil?  
By not feeding this this evil  
The food it needs to grow  
Its food is fear  
So do not give it its nourishment  
Give it the antidote that will  
Extinguish its illusionary power  

Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  

Good overcomes evil  
Love overcomes evil  
Kindness overcomes evil  
Love and kindness is light  
That disperses darkness that is this evil  
So we must give it light when its dark  
We must give it love when its hateful  
We must be kind to it when it behaves like a monstrosity  
We must expose it lies with the light of truth  

Truth cannot leave, and lies cannot stay  
The real cannot leave, and fake cannot stay  
No matter how hard, no matter how difficult  
No matter how shameful this evil appears to be  
No matter how devious this evil  
No matter how demeaning this evil  
No matter how cunning this evil  
No matter how deceitful this evil  
No matter how devilish this evil  

Good people of the world, unite as one  
We as one must end this evil for ever  
Not through fear but in truth we stand together  
Gathering courageousness from the light of truth  
Standing together, steadfast with this bright light  
Of truth  
This evil does dissolve for it is powerless when its  
Food is taken away  
Take away its food and we only feed it love,  
Kindness, peace, joy, happiness  
It cannot stand anything that is good  
So we must give it all things that are good  

Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  

Love will conquer all  

Truth cannot leave, and lies cannot stay  
The real cannot leave, and fake cannot stay  

No matter how hard  
No matter how difficult  
No matter how shameful  
No matter how devious  
No matter how demeaning  
No matter how cunning  
No matter how deceitful  
No matter how devilish  
No matter how evil  

Good people of the world, unite as one  
We as one must end this evil for ever  
Not through fear but in truth we stand together  
Gathering courageousness from the light of truth  
Standing together, steadfast with this bright light  
Of truth  
This evil does dissolve for it is powerless when its  
Food is taken away  
Take away its food and we only feed it love,  
Kindness, peace, joy, happiness  
It cannot stand anything that is good  
So we must give it all things that are good  

Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all  
Love will conquer all
