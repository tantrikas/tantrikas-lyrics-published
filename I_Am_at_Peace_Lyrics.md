# I Am at Peace

**Lyrics**

---

## Verse 1  
I am at peace with all I am,  
The silent flame, the sacred span.  
My breath is calm, my heart is wide,  
I walk with truth, with love as guide.  

## Verse 2  
I hold no war within my soul,  
No fractured part, I now make whole.  
The world and I no longer fight,  
We're woven one in holy light.  

## Chorus  
I love everyone, and all love me,  
Like rivers flowing to the sea.  
No fear remains, no walls, no chain â€”  
Just open skies and gentle rain.  

## Verse 3  
I send out grace with every word,  
And in return, my prayers are heard.  
No door is locked, no gift denied,  
The universe stands on my side.  

## Bridge *(spoken or sung)*  
The floodgates of my good now rise,  
A tide of blessings from the skies.  
Abundance pours, and I receive,  
With open arms and heart that believes.  

## Chorus â€“ *repeat with feeling*  
I love everyone, and all love me,  
Like sunlight dancing on the sea.  
Peace in my mind, joy in my blood â€”  
Now I receive the holy flood.  

## Outro â€“ *softly*  
I am at peace...  
I am in love...  
I am the open gate...  
I am enough.
