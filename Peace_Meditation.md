# Peace Meditation

I am at peace with all I am\
The silent flame, the sacred span\
My breath is calm, my heart is wide\
I walk with truth, with love as guide

I hold no war within my soul\
No fractured part, I now make whole\
The world and I no longer fight\
We're woven one in holy light

I love everyone, and all love me\
Like rivers flowing to the sea\
No fear remains, no walls, no chain\
Just open skies and gentle rain

I send out grace with every word\
And in return, my prayers are heard\
No door is locked, no gift denied\
The universe stands on my side

The floodgates of my good now rise\
A tide of blessings from the skies\
Abundance pours, and I receive\
With open arms and heart that believes

I love everyone, and all love me\
Like sunlight dancing on the sea\
Peace in my mind, joy in my blood\
Now I receive the holy flood

I am at peace\
I am in love\
I am the open gate\
I am enough

I am at peace with all I am\
The silent flame, the sacred span\
My breath is calm, my heart is wide\
I walk with truth, with love as guide

I hold no war within my soul\
No fractured part, I now make whole\
The world and I no longer fight\
We're woven one in holy light

I love everyone, and all love me\
Like rivers flowing to the sea\
No fear remains, no walls, no chain\
Just open skies and gentle rain

I send out grace with every word\
And in return, my prayers are heard\
No door is locked, no gift denied\
The universe stands on my side

The floodgates of my good now rise\
A tide of blessings from the skies\
Abundance pours, and I receive\
With open arms and heart that believes

I love everyone, and all love me\
Like sunlight dancing on the sea\
Peace in my mind, joy in my blood\
Now I receive the holy flood

I am at peace\
I am in love\
I am the open gate\
I am enough

I am at peace with all I am\
The silent flame, the sacred span\
My breath is calm, my heart is wide\
I walk with truth, with love as guide

I hold no war within my soul\
No fractured part, I now make whole\
The world and I no longer fight\
We're woven one in holy light

I love everyone, and all love me\
Like rivers flowing to the sea\
No fear remains, no walls, no chain\
Just open skies and gentle rain

I send out grace with every word\
And in return, my prayers are heard\
No door is locked, no gift denied\
The universe stands on my side

The floodgates of my good now rise\
A tide of blessings from the skies\
Abundance pours, and I receive\
With open arms and heart that believes

I love everyone, and all love me\
Like sunlight dancing on the sea\
Peace in my mind, joy in my blood\
Now I receive the holy flood

I am at peace\
I am in love\
I am the open gate\
I am enough
