# Midnight Pulse

## Verse 1  
You called me up when the world went quiet  
Said you needed someone to hold you tight  
I drove across town in the darkness  
Found you waiting by your window light  

*Baby, I know we shouldn't be here*  
*But your touch makes everything clear*  
*When the sun comes up we'll pretend*  
*That this moment has to end*

## Pre-Chorus  
But right now it's just me and you  
Nothing else we have to do  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Chorus  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, we come alive*  
ðŸ’« *No rules, no shame, just you and I*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, we tell the truth*  
ðŸ’« *Bodies speaking what we can't say*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, after midnight*  
*(La, la, la, la)*  
ðŸ’« *This is where we both belong*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, after midnight*  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Verse 2  
Your silk dress falls to the bedroom floor  
I trace your skin like I've done before  
We move together in the lamplight  
Every breath feels so right  

*You whisper secrets in my ear*  
*All the things I want to hear*  
*When morning breaks we'll walk away*  
*But tonight we're here to stay*

## Pre-Chorus  
But right now it's just me and you  
Nothing else we have to do  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Chorus  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, we come alive*  
ðŸ’« *No rules, no shame, just you and I*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, we tell the truth*  
ðŸ’« *Bodies speaking what we can't say*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, after midnight*  
*(La, la, la, la)*  
ðŸ’« *This is where we both belong*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, after midnight*  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Bridge  
I know you got somebody waiting  
I know this is complicated  
But when you call me in the darkness  
I can't help but come running  
*(Running to you, baby)*  
*Running to you*  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Solo  
*(Mmm, hmm, hmm)*  
*(La, la, la, la)*  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Chorus  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, we come alive*  
ðŸ’« *No rules, no shame, just you and I*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, we tell the truth*  
ðŸ’« *Bodies speaking what we can't say*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, after midnight*  
*(La, la, la, la)*  
ðŸ’« *This is where we both belong*  
ðŸ’« *After midnight, after midnight*  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*

## Outro  
When the clock strikes twelve  
I'll be waiting for you  
*After midnight*  
*(After midnight)*  
*After midnight*  
*(Oh, oh, oh)*  
That's when we're free  
*(La, la, la, la)*
