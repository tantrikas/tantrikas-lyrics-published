# let go and let god 1

---

### Verse 1 *(Soft, reflective)*  
When the weight feels heavy on your soul,  
And the storm wonâ€™t seem to let you go,  
Every step you take feels like the road wonâ€™t endâ€”  
Just whisper His name and trust again.

---

### Pre-Chorus *(Gentle rise, hopeful)*  
You donâ€™t have to fight this on your own,  
Lay it down before His throne.

---

### Chorus *(Full, powerful, with choir harmonies)*  
**Let go and let God lead the way,**  
**He holds your future, night and day.**  
**Surrender all your fear and pain,**  
**His love will lift you once again.**  
**Oh, just let goâ€”and let God reign!**

---

### Verse 2 *(Tender, reassuring)*  
When the doubts are louder than His voice,  
And your heart canâ€™t seem to find the choice,  
Heâ€™s the light that guides you through the unknown,  
Youâ€™re never walking all alone.

---

*(Repeat Pre-Chorus & Chorus)*

---

### Bridge *(Intimate, then swelling)*  
Oh, the chains will break,  
When you trust in faith,  
Every burden fades awayâ€”  
In His arms, youâ€™re safe.

---

*(Big crescendo, choir joins triumphantly)*

---

### Final Chorus *(x2, softer ending)*  
**Let go and let God lead the way,**  
**Heâ€™s writing grace on every page.**  
**No more striving, no more fearâ€”**  
**Just His peace so loud and clear.**  
**Oh, just let goâ€”and let God here...**

---

*(End with soft piano & choir humming, fading into silence.)*
