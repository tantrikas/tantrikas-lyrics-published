# The Eternal Message

So the Wheel began  
To turn that day  
And still it turns  
In hearts that pray  

Not bound to temple  
Robe  
Or name  

But in each breath  
The timeless flame  

Walk gently, seeker  
Walk with grace  
Between extremes lies  
The sacred place  

The Middle Way  
Serene and free  
Opens the gate  
To Eternity  

Suffering known  
Its cause released  
The craving quenched  
The heart in peace  

The Wheel still turning  
In every age  
Truth reborn on  
Life’s vast stage
