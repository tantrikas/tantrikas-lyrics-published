# Body Healing Meditation

Mmmm...  
I am whole  
I am perfect  
I am strong  
I am powerful  
I am loving  
I am harmonious  
I am happy  

Rising with the morning sun  
Every breath, a new day's begun  
Healing flows through heart and mind  
Leaving yesterday behind  

I am whole  
I am perfect  
I am strong  
I am powerful  
I am loving  
I am harmonious  
I am happy  

Like a river flowing free  
Nature's strength lives inside me  
Every cell renewed with light  
Spirit soaring, taking flight  

In this moment, I am free  
All the good flowing through me  
Peace and healing, from above  
Wrapped in endless waves of love  

I am whole  
I am perfect  
I am strong  
I am powerful  
I am loving  
I am harmonious  
I am happy  

Each step forward brings me peace  
As my wisdom finds release  
Trust and faith guide me along  
In my heart, a gentle song  

In this moment, I am free  
All the good flowing through me  
Peace and healing, from above  
Wrapped in endless waves of love  

I am whole  
I am perfect  
I am strong  
I am powerful  
I am loving  
I am harmonious  
I am happy  

Growing stronger day by day  
As the pain just fades away  
Finding balance, finding grace  
In this sacred, healing space  
Walking forward, brave and true  
As my spirit breaks through  
Every blessing multiplies  
As I reach toward brighter skies  

Mmmm...  
I am whole  
I am perfect  
I am strong  
I am powerful  
I am loving  
I am harmonious  
I am happy
