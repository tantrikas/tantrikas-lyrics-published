# LAW OF ATTRACTION — ASK · BELIEVE · RECEIVE

There are three steps to manifesting  
Simple, clear, and true  

**Ask**  
**Believe**  
**And then receive**  

---

The first and last are effortless  
They move like breath and tide  
But the middle step is fragile  
Where the shadows hide  

For when I ask, I know my desire  
And when I receive, I understand  
But when I stand in believing  
I feel resistance in my hands  

Fear whispers softly  
Doubt asks *“what if?”*  
And every hidden emotion  
Pulls belief apart in bits  

The universe responds to truth alone  
Not the mask I try to wear  
It hears the thoughts beneath my words  
And feels my hidden fear  

So I look within with honesty  
No judgment, no disguise  
I witness every doubt and wound  
With open, loving eyes  

---

I release my fear  
I release my doubt  
I release my anger  
I let it all fall out  

No blame  
No fight  
No need to pretend  
No jealousy  
No resentment  

Nothing to push  
Nothing to pull  
Nothing I need to defend  

---

When there is no attraction  
And no aversion left inside  
No complaints against the moment  
No resistance to the tide  

The mind grows still  
The heart grows wide  
The path is clear and true  
Belief is no longer effort  
It’s what’s left when blocks are through  

And in this space of quiet knowing  
The middle way appears  
All blocks dissolve into the light  
All outcomes draw me near  

---

**I ask**  
**I believe**  
**I receive**  
*Effortless and free*
