# The Law of Nonresistance



# Opening Mantra (Soprano, floating â€” layered or call-and-response)

"The law of nonresistance... is the law of coordination."  
(Breathe)  
"The more I yield, the more aligns..."  
"The more I yield, the more aligns..."  
(Return to mantra)  
"The law of nonresistance... is the law of coordination."

## Verse 1 (Spoken, slow build â€” tension/release)

Most people resist the sacred moments...  
They fight lack with clenched hearts,  
They battle illness with shaking faith,  
They deny heartbreak with blinded eyes.  
But in resisting these visitors,  
They tie them to the soul like anchors...  
And wonder why they do not leave.

## Bridge (Round-style, rising intensity)

The law of nonresistance...  
...can be tested in small, soft ways.  
The law of nonresistance...  
...can be tested in still, slow days.  
Try it nowâ€”just breathe and stay.  
Let the tide come... then float away.

## \[Turning Point] (Sacred silence â†’ harp, grace-filled)

If you are criticized, unjustly, deeply...  
Do not thunder back in fear.  
Stand soft, and stillâ€”  
and the sharpness will fade...  
like mist before morning sun.

## \[Final Liberation] (Choir â€” expansive, soaring)

Always remember this truth:  
The wind of the Holy Spirit is constantâ€”strong.  
But you... must raise your sail.  
You must raise your sail... toward heaven.  
(All voices:)  -
Let the wind do what effort cannot.  
Let the wind do what effort cannot.
