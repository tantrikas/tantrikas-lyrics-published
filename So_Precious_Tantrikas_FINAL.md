# So Precious

Mm-mm... ahhh\
La-la-love

She walks into the room\
And the light changes key\
Like the sun learned a new melody\
Tiny hands, big universe\
Heartbeat teaching me how to breathe

She walks into the room\
And the light changes key\
Like the sun learned a new melody

Every laugh is a doorway\
Every tear is a prayer\
I didn't know my soul\
Had this much care

She is so wonderful\
So precious\
Such a delight\
Most amazing being\
Dancing in my sight

She is so wonderful\
So precious\
Every day, every night\
Most amazing being\
Amazing gift from divine

Divine... di-di-divine

Morning hair, sleepy eyes\
World still new, still bright\
She says my name\
Like it means something sacred\
Like it's wrapped in light

Ba-dum... ba-dum\
Little feet on a wooden floor\
Ba-dum... ba-dum\
Love knocking at my core

So happy to be able to take care of her\
To hold her fears and her wonder\
To learn again how to play\
To see forever inside today

So happy to be able to take care of her\
To be the arms she runs into\
To grow while she grows\
To love without a clue how deep it goes

She is so wonderful\
So precious\
Such a delight\
Most amazing being\
Shining in my life

She is so wonderful\
So precious\
Morning, noon, midnight\
Most amazing being\
Amazing gift from divine

Ah-oh, ah-oh, thank you\
Ah-oh, ah-oh, thank you

Eh-laa... eh-laa\
Mm-mm\
Love learns a name\
And the name is light

Mm-mm\
She is
