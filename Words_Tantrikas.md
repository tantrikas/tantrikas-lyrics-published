# Words

## Lyrics

Say it loud, say it true  
Every wordâ€™s coming back to you  
Yeah, yeah  
Words like bullets, words like gold  
Speak it hot or speak it cold  
Every lineâ€™s a little spell  
Lift it up or drop to hell  
You talk it, you walk it  
You plant it, you rock it  
Every word's got roots  
So bless that socket  
By thy words â€” justified  
By thy words â€” amplified  
Say it right, make it fly  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify  
Your Words  
Your Words  

What you say is what you grow  
Truth, lies, highs, lows  
Speak in love â€” and watch it glow  
Speak it sweet â€” you vibe elite  
Talk that light â€” move your feet  
No hate, no pain, no fear  
Just blessings in your atmosphere  
By thy words â€” justified  
By thy words â€” electrified  
Say it real, say it bold  
Your mouthâ€™s the magic, strike that gold  

Say it loud, say it true  
Every wordâ€™s coming back to you  
Yeah, yeah  
Words like bullets, words like gold  
Speak it hot or speak it cold  
Every lineâ€™s a little spell  
Lift it up or drop to hell  
You talk it, you walk it  
You plant it, you rock it  
Every word's got roots  
So bless that socket  
By thy words â€” justified  
By thy words â€” amplified  
Say it right, make it fly  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify  
Your Words  
Your Words  

You talk it, you walk it  
You plant it, you rock it  
Every word's got roots  
So bless that socket  
By thy words â€” justified  
By thy words â€” amplified  
Say it right, make it fly  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify  
Your Words  
Your Words
