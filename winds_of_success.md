# Winds of Success

## Intro – 20s Instrumental
- Ambient textures, filtered 808s pulsing softly.  
- Saxophone plays a breathy, wandering motif.  
- Whispered ad-libs: *“four winds… endless good…”*  

**Lyrics:**  
*The four winds blow, they’re callin’ my name,*  
*North, South, East, West — it all feels the same.*  
*Success in the air, it’s my own, I claim,*  
*Endless good, endless good — pourin’ down like rain.*  

---

## Verse 1
*I stand in the center, the world in my view,*  
*Every breeze that I feel carries something that’s true.*  
*Whispers of promise, the night turns to day,*  
*Every wind that surrounds me is showin’ the way.*  

---

## Instrumental Break – 12–16 bars
- Saxophone solo over moody chords + deep 808s.  
- Background vocal hums (“mmm… ohhh…”) layered.

## Hook
*The four winds blow, they’re callin’ my name,*  
*North, South, East, West — it all feels the same.*  
*Success in the air, it’s my own, I claim,*  
*Endless good, endless good — pourin’ down like rain.*  

---

## Verse 2
*Like tides on the shoreline, the blessings arrive,*  
*From the corners of the earth, they keep me alive.*  
*No beginning, no ending, this river runs free,*  
*Every current of love is returnin’ to me.*  

---

## Bridge
*Winds surround me… (winds surround me…)*  
*Lift me higher… (lift me higher…)*  
*Endless good flows… (endless good flows…)*  
*Never-ending fire… (never-ending fire…)*  

(repeat with lush vocal layers, soaring soul delivery)
