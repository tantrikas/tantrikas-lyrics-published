# LAW OF ATTRACTION (BELIEVE)

Believing is not a thought\
Believing is a feeling

And this is where resistance hides\
This is where the noise appears

Fear rises\
Doubt whispers\
Old memories speak loudly

What if it doesn't happen\
What if I fail\
What if I am wrong

Belief collapses under pressure\
When emotions pull in opposite directions

I notice the resistance\
I do not fight it\
I allow it to be seen

The universe cannot be fooled\
By forced smiles\
Or borrowed faith

It hears what I don't say\
It feels what I hide

So I turn inward\
With absolute honesty\
With sincerity\
Without judgment

I see my fear\
I see my doubt\
I see my anger\
I see my jealousy

And I do not push them away

I see it\
I feel it\
I allow it

I release fear\
I release doubt

I release anger\
I release resentment

I release jealousy\
I release comparison

No complaints\
No resistance\
No inner argument

Nothing to prove\
Nothing to defend\
Nothing to fight

Let it soften\
Let it pass\
Let it dissolve

I am not broken\
Nothing is wrong\
These emotions were only signals

And now they are free to go
