# Subconscious Mind

## Part 1

**Intro (instrumental)**  

_Subconscious mind… faithful servant._  
_Subconscious mind… silent witness._  
_Faith instead of fear…_  
_Only good, only good._  

**instrumental pause**  

Subconscious mind has no  
sense of humor, and people  
often joke themselves  
into unhappy experiences.  

**instrumental pause**  

For example, a woman who had  
a great deal of money,  
joked continually about  
“getting ready for the poorhouse.”  

**instrumental pause**  

In a few years she was  
almost destitute, having  
impressed the subconscious mind  
with a picture of lack  
and limitation.  

**instrumental pause**  

_(Echo chant)_  
_A picture of lack… a picture of limitation._  

**instrumental pause**  

Fortunately, the law works  
both ways, and a situation  
of lack may be changed to  
one of plenty.  

**instrumental pause**  

There is always plenty on  
man’s pathway;  
but it can only be brought  
into manifestation through  
desire, faith, or the  
spoken word.  
But man must make the first move.  
_Yes — man must make the first move._  

**instrumental pause**  

**(Chorus)**  
_Ask, and it shall be given._  
_Seek, and ye shall find._  
_Knock… knock…_  
_and it shall be opened unto you._  

**instrumental pause**  

In the scriptures it is said:  
_Concerning the works of my hands,_  
_command ye me._  

**instrumental pause**  

Infinite Intelligence — God — is  
ever ready to carry out  
man’s smallest or greatest demands.  

**instrumental pause**  

Every desire, uttered or unexpressed,  
is a demand.  
We are often startled by  
having a wish suddenly fulfilled.  

**instrumental pause**  

**(Bridge / refrain)**  
_Subconscious mind… faithful servant._  
_Subconscious mind… silent listener._  

**Outro (instrumental)**

**Intro (Instrumental)**  

Nothing stands between man and his  
highest ideals and every desire  
of his heart, but doubt and fear.  
When man can wish without worrying,  
every desire will be instantly fulfilled.  
For this reason, fear must be erased  
from the consciousness.  
It is man’s only enemy — fear  
of lack, fear of failure,  
fear of sickness, fear of loss,  
and a feeling of insecurity  
on some plane.  

**instrumental pause**  

**(Chorus)**  
_Faith instead of fear…_  
_Faith instead of fear…_  
_Faith instead of fear…_  
_Only good is here._  

So we can see we must  
substitute faith for fear,  
for fear is only inverted faith;  
it is faith in evil instead of good.  

The object of the game of life  
is to see clearly one’s good  
and to obliterate all mental  
pictures of evil.  

**instrumental pause**  

This must be done by impressing  
the subconscious mind with  
a realization of good.  

“Why worry, it will probably  
never happen.”  

By having these words stamped  
upon your subconscious mind,  
and having a firm conviction  
that only good can come into  
your life, therefore only  
good can manifest.  

**Outro:**  
_instrumental_

**Intro:**  
_instrumental_  

Subconscious mind is man’s faithful servant,  
but one must be careful  
to give it the right orders.  
Man has ever a silent listener  
at his side — his subconscious mind.  

Every thought, every word is  
impressed upon it and  
carried out in amazing detail.  

**instrumental pause**  

It is like a singer making  
a record on the sensitive  
disc of the phonographic plate.  
Every note and tone of the  
singer’s voice registered.  
If he coughs or hesitates,  
it is registered also.  

So let us break all the  
old bad records in the  
subconscious mind — the records  
of our lives which we do not  
wish to keep — and make new  
and beautiful ones.  

**instrumental pause**  

**(Bridge)**  
_Break the old…_  
_Make the new…_  
_Health, Wealth, Love, Expression true._  

Speak these words aloud,  
with power and conviction:  

“I now smash and demolish  
(by my spoken word)  
every untrue record in  
my subconscious mind.  
They shall return to the  
dust-heap of their native  
nothingness, for they came from  
my own vain imaginings.  

**instrumental pause**  

I now make my perfect records  
through the God within —  
The records of Health,  
Wealth, Love, and Perfect  
Self-Expression.  

This is the square of life,  
The Game completed.”  

_Subconscious mind… faithful servant._  
_Death and Life… are in the tongue._  
_Faith instead of fear…_  
_Only good… only good…_  
_Only good can come._  

**Outro (Instrumental)**
