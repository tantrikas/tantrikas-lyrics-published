# Life is a Game

---

### Verse 1  
Most people consider life a battle  
But it is not a battle, it is a game  
It is a game, you need to know the rules  
Spiritual law lights the way, old and new

---

### Chorus  
**Giving and Receiving, that's the key**  
**What you send out will return, you'll see**  
**The rules are clear, the path is true**  
**What you give is what comes back to you**

---

### Verse 2  
Give your hate, and hate finds its way home  
Give your love, and love won't leave you alone  
Your criticism circles back around  
Your lies and cheats come tumbling down

---

*(Repeat Chorus)*

---

### Bridge  
The choice is yours in this game of life  
Plant your seeds with wisdom and light  
For what you sow, you're bound to reap  
These ancient truths are yours to keep
