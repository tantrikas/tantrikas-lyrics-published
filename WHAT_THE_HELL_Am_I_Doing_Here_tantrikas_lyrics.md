# WHAT THE HELL (Am I Doing Here)
*Gospel / World Version*  

---

## Intro (chant-like, soft percussion builds)
What the hell...  
Am I doing here?  
Oh Lord, what’s this life about?  
Every day the same…  
Round and round... round and round...  

---

## Verse 1
Day in, day out, I walk this road  
Same old story, same old load  
Eyes wide open, heart half-closed  
Living the motion, forgetting the soul  

What the hell, what the hell  
Am I doing here?  
What’s the meaning, what’s the plan?  
Can you hear me, God, can you hear?  

---

## Chorus (choir and drums rise)
Same thing, same thing  
Repeat, repeat  
From morning to night  
Repeat, repeat  
But deep in my heart  
A voice is clear —  
Child, you’re waking up  
You are already here  

(Choir echoes)  
You are already here…  
You are already here…  

---

## Verse 2
In the mirror I see my face  
But who’s behind these human shades?  
The world keeps turning, I still pray —  
Show me the light through this masquerade  

What the hell, what the hell  
Am I doing here?  
Maybe this fire, this doubt, this fear  
Are all just steps to bring You near  

---

## Bridge (softer, meditative call and response)
🎵 *Call:* What the hell am I doing here?  
🎶 *Response:* Finding the holy in the ordinary  
🎵 *Call:* What the hell is life about?  
🎶 *Response:* Learning love through the shadow of doubt  
🎵 *Call:* Day in, day out — same thing, same thing  
🎶 *Response:* Every breath’s a prayer, awakening  

---

## Chorus (full power, drums + bass + harmonies)
Same thing, same thing  
Repeat, repeat  
From morning to night  
Repeat, repeat  
But now I see  
It’s all divine —  
This endless loop  
Is love in time  

(Choir swell)  
What the hell, what the hell  
Am I doing here?  
I’m finding God  
Right now, right here  

---

## Outro (soft, transcendent)
What the hell... (whispered)  
Am I doing here?  
(smiling)  
I’m home...  
I’m home…  

(soft percussion fades into heartbeat rhythm)

## Alternate Version (Simplified / Spoken)
**Verse 1**  
What the hell…  
Am I doing here?  
Running in circles  
Year after year  
Wake up, same walls  
Same streets, same fear  
What the hell…  
Am I doing here?  

**Chorus**  
Day in, day out  
Same thing, same thing  
From morning to night  
Repeat, repeat  
Caught in the loop  
No end in sight  
Same thing, same thing  
Repeat, repeat  

**Verse 2**  
Is this the dream I was told to chase?  
Or some illusion I can’t erase?  
I watch the clock, I fade away  
I lose my soul in shades of gray  

**Bridge**  
What if I stop, just breathe, just feel?  
What if this pain is how I heal?  
Maybe the answer’s been so near…  
Inside the silence, crystal clear  

**Chorus — extended**  
Day in, day out  
Same thing, same thing  
From morning to night  
Repeat, repeat  
But somewhere inside  
A spark appears  
Whispers softly —  
“I’m waking here.”  

**Outro — spoken or sung**  
What the hell…  
Am I doing here?  
Maybe finding  
Myself…  
Right here.
