# "Let Go and Let God" (Full Upbeat Gospel + Rap Version)

---

### Verse 1 (Joyful, declarative)  
Iâ€™ve carried burdens, tried to run the show,  
Fighting battles that I wasnâ€™t meant to hold!  
But then I heard Heaven whisper soft and lowâ€”  
"Child, Iâ€™ve got thisâ€”just let it go!"

---

### Pre-Chorus (Call-and-response!)  
So Iâ€™m dropping every chain! *(Drop it!)*  
Giving up my pain! *(Give it up!)*  
Hands up high, Iâ€™m free at lastâ€”  
Grace has got me, never looking back!

---

### Chorus (Full choir + horns!)  
**LET GO AND LET GOD DO WHAT HE DO!** *(Oh yeah!)*  
He moves mountainsâ€”watch Him see you through!  
No more worry, no more fearâ€”  
Every step is guided here!  
Just let goâ€”and watch Him appear!

---

### Verse 2 (Testimony swag!)  
Dreams I thought were dead? Heâ€™s breathing life!  
Storms that tried to wreck me? Heâ€™s calmed the tide!  
Now Iâ€™m dancing where I used to cry,  
â€˜Cause His power works when I stop trying!

---

(Repeat Pre-Chorus & Chorus)

### ðŸ”¥ RAP BRIDGE ðŸ”¥ (Beat drops to bass + stomps)  
*(Aggressive, triumphant flowâ€”think KB or Lecrae!)*

**"Ayy, I used to stress, trynaâ€™ fix the script,  
Like Iâ€™m the authorâ€”nah, I had to quit!  
God said, â€˜Sit back, watch Me move,â€™  
Every closed door? Heâ€™s the skeleton key too!**  

**Anxiety loud, but my faith Louder,  
Devil in my ear? I just shout â€˜OUT HER!â€™  
Yâ€™all can keep the weight, Iâ€™m dropping mine,  
Jirehâ€™s on the caseâ€”Heâ€™s right on time!**  

**From the pit to the palace, thatâ€™s the story,  
My hands off the wheelâ€”now He gets the glory!  
So if youâ€™re tired of the fight, take a breath and thenâ€¦  
LET. GO. AND. WATCH. HIM. WIN! *(Ayee!)*"**

---

**(BEAT PAUSEâ€”then DRUM FILL + CHOIR EXPLODES!)**

---

### Final Chorus *(x2, ad-libs!)*  
**LET GO AND LET GOD DO WHAT HE DO!** *(Do it, Jesus!)*  
Heâ€™s got victory in store for you! *(Store for you!)*  
Wave goodbye to old despairâ€”  
Miracles are in the air!  
Just let goâ€”and **LEAVE IT THERE!**

---

### Outro (Celebration jam!)  
*(Choir shouts, horns blast, congregational clapsâ€”fade out on joy!)*
