# The Imagination

## Lyrics

**Intro: instrumental**

The imagination has been called,\
*"The Scissors of The Mind,"*\
and it is ever cutting,\
cutting, day by day,\
the pictures man sees there,\
and sooner or later he\
meets his own creations\
in his outer world.\
**Imagination is the scissors of the Mind**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

To train the imagination successfully,\
man must understand the workings\
of his mind. The Greeks said:\
*"Know Thy Self."*\
*"Know Thy Self."*\
*"Know Thy Self."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

There are three departments of the mind,\
the subconscious, conscious and\
superconscious.\
The subconscious, is simply power,\
without direction.\
without direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

It is like steam or electricity,\
and it does what it is\
directed to do;\
it has no power of induction.\
it has no power of induction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

Whatever man feels deeply\
or images clearly,\
is impressed on the subconscious mind,\
and carried out in smallest detail.\
carried out in smallest detail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

Once a picture is impressed\
on the subconscious mind,\
then, in due time it will\
work itself out, regardless\
of the havoc or jubilation,\
the result may create.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

The conscious mind has been called\
mortal or carnal mind.\
It is the human mind and\
sees life as it appears to be.\
It sees death, disaster, sickness,\
poverty and limitations\
of every kind, and it impresses\
the subconscious.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

The superconscious mind is\
the God Mind within each man,\
and is the realm of perfect ideas.\
In it, is the *"perfect pattern"*\
spoken of by Plato,\
**The Divine Design;**\
for there is a Divine Design\
for each person.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

*"There is a place that\
you are to fill and\
no one else can fill,\
something you are to do,\
which no one else can do."*\
There is a perfect picture\
of this in the superconscious mind.\
It usually flashes across\
the conscious as an\
unattainable ideal -\
*"something too good to be true."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**instrumental pause**

In reality it is man's true\
destiny (or destination)\
flashed to him from the\
Infinite Intelligence\
which is within himself.\
Many people, however, are in\
ignorance of their true\
destinies and are striving\
for things and situations which\
do not belong to them,\
and would only bring failure\
and dissatisfaction if attained.
