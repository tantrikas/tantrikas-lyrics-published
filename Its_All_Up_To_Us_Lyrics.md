# 🎵 ITS ALL UP TO US

## Lyrics

### Spoken softly over ambient music
*It’s all up to us...*  
We hold the power.  
The power to choose...  
The magic of intuition —  
Or the long, winding road of the reasoning mind.  

---

### 🌟 Verse 1 – Meditative tone
Follow the superconscious —  
And you’ll rise to the heights.  
Within the intuition  
Are the pictures of eternal youth,  
Eternal life —  
Where even death is overcome.  

We have the power  
To impress the subconscious  
With images divine —  
Of youth that never fades,  
Of life that never ends.  

---

### 🌀 Chorus – Sung or chanted gently
🎶 Let me now express the Divine Design...  
🎶 In my mind, my body, and all my life...  
🎶 Let me rise, let me shine, let me be — divine...  
🎶 It’s all up to us... It’s all up to me...  

---

### 🏞️ Verse 2 – Spoken over light rhythm
Like Shangrila — the World of the Wondrous —  
Where all is perfect...  
There exists a spiritual prototype  
Of your body and your life.  

It’s called the Divine Design —  
A perfect idea  
Within your superconscious mind.  

But most have stamped another image:  
Disease... old age... death.  

And the subconscious?  
It carries out the order,  
Faithfully, silently.  

Now it’s time to give a new command...  

---

### 🌠 Bridge – Whispered or echo-effect
*"Let me now express...  
The Divine Idea  
In my mind,  
My body,  
My affairs..."*  

---

### 💫 Chorus – Louder, more passionate
🎶 Let me now express the Divine Design...  
🎶 In my mind, my body, and all my life...  
🎶 Let me rise, let me shine, let me be — divine...  
🎶 It’s all up to us... It’s all up to me...  

---

### 🛡️ Verse 3 – Rhythmic, empowering tone
Lift up your heads, O gates!  
Be lifted, you ancient doors —  
That the King of Glory may enter in.  

Who is this King of Glory?  
The Lord strong and mighty —  
The Law, mighty in battle.  

This is the perfect idea  
From the Superconscious...  
Breaking through the walls,  
Flooding the mind.  

The gates are lifted —  
The King of Glory comes in.  

---

### ⚔️ Verse 4 – Spoken like a battle cry, over rising drums
This King of Glory has weapons you’ve never seen —  
It scatters the army of negative thoughts  
Entrenched for generations...  

"Life is hard,"  
"Dreams don’t come true,"  
"Love always fades..."  

These are lies we’ve repeated —  
But now we rewrite the code.  

For "Out of the imaginations of the heart  
Come the issues of life."  

---

### 🌿 Break – Calm, reassuring
God’s ways...  
Are ways of peace.  
Let us picture harmony.  
Let us build beauty.  
And one day —  
That vision will take form.  

---

### 🌈 Final Chorus – Uplifting, victorious
🎶 Let me now express the Divine Design...  
🎶 In my mind, my body, and all my life...  
🎶 Let me rise, let me shine, let me be — divine...  
🎶 It’s all up to us... It’s all up to me...  

---

### Spoken like a mantra fading out
We are fully equipped...  
For the Divine Plan.  
More than enough for every trial.  
Doors open...  
Channels clear...  
Infinite Intelligence flows...  
The Divine Idea...  
Comes to pass.  

It’s all up to us...  
And we are ready.
