# Wheel of Dhamma

## Lyrics

**Beneath the tree of silence bright**  
Awakened eyes behold the light  
From stillness spoke the Boundless One  
The Wheel of Dhamma has begun  

### The Call

Walkers of the middle way  
Leave the night, embrace the day  
No pleasure-chain, no thorn of pain  
Peace between - the heart’s domain  

Turn, O Wheel, turn within  
End of sorrow, end of sin  
Truth arising, shining clear  
The path of freedom now is here  

### The First Truth

Birth and death, the tides of tears  
Joy that fades through passing years  
Holding tight brings ache anew  
All conditioned things are due  

See the world as streams that flow  
Nothing fixed, yet all we know  
From clinging comes the wound we feel  
Release the grasp — the heart will heal  

### The Cause and the End

Craving burns, the fire of thirst  
Wanting more — the endless curse  
When the fire finds no more fuel  
Peace descends, the waters cool  

Turn, O Wheel, turn within  
End of sorrow, end of sin  
Truth arising, shining clear  
The path of freedom now is here  

### The Eightfold Path

Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Deed  
Right Way of Life, Right Effort’s seed  
Right Mind, Right Calm — the circle whole  
Leads the traveler home to soul  

Guide us, Teacher, gentle, mild  
Walk the Path, O heart, undefiled  
Show us peace beyond all name  
Nibbāna’s light, the deathless flame  

### The Turning

When Truth was spoken, heavens sang  
Echoed joy through worlds that rang  
All that rises must decline  
All that ends reveals the Sign  

Wheel of Dhamma, roll forever  
Through each heart and every weather  
From the Bodhi to the sky  
Still the song — no one dies  

Middle Way - shining bright  
Form is fading into light  
Wheel of Dhamma, turn inside  
Peace, compassion, open wide
