# Vibe (Dance Groove)

## Lyrics

### [Verse 1]
Hey, just saw you  
At the club last night  
Moving different  
Something's so right  
Everything you do  
Turns to pure light  
(Oh-oh, yeah)

### [Pre-Chorus]
Watching you shine  
Breaking through walls  
Climbing so high  
Above it all  
(Watch them, watch them fall)

### [Chorus]
Everything you touch (yeah)  
Turns to success  
Can't deny your power  
I must confess  
Look at you now (oh)  
Taking your crown  
Everyone's watching  
As you break down bounds  
(La-la-la, watch you shine)

### [Verse 2]
Text you at night  
"Keep crushing it, babe"  
Your confidence speaks  
In every way  
They didn't believe  
Now they all pay  
(Watch this, uh-huh)

### [Bridge]
**(Call & Response)**  
"Who's that boss?" (You are!)  
"Who's on top?" (You are!)  
"Who can't stop?" (You are!)  
"Show them what you got!"

### [Breakdown]
**[Brass hits]**  
Started from nothing  
Built your own throne  
Now they all follow  
Where you roam  
(Yeah, yeah)

### [Chorus]
Everything you touch (yeah)  
Turns to success  
Can't deny your power  
I must confess  
Look at you now (oh)  
Taking your crown  
Everyone's watching  
As you break down bounds  
(La-la-la, watch you shine)

### [Outro]
**[Brass section builds]**  
Keep rising higher  
Show them your fire  
(You got this, you got this)  
**[Fade with brass flourish]**
