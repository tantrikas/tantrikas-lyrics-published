# All is Perfect (Mellow Mix)

## Lyrics

```
[Verse 1]
Morning comes so softly now
Cup of tea, and there you are
In the quiet moments here
I feel you closer than a star
(I feel you here with me)

[Chorus]
Light pours in, light pours through
Everything is whole and true
Light pours in, light pours through
All is perfect, me and you

[Verse 2]
Drawing back these curtains slow
Watching as the day unfolds
A whisper carried in the air
With more than enough for us to share
(More than we could know)

[Chorus]
Light pours in, light pours through
Everything is whole and true
Light pours in, light pours through
All is perfect, me and you

[Bridge] (harmonies building)
You showed me how to see
The wonder found in me
Divine order flows
In everything that grows
And now I know, and now I know

[Verse 3]
Simple truth was waiting here
In the space between each breath
All the answers that we need
In this moment, nothingâ€™s missed
(Nothing left to fear)

[Final Chorus]
Light pours in, light pours through
Everything is whole and true
Light pours in, light pours through
All is perfect, me and you
(All is perfect)
Light pours in, we shine anew
(Everything divine, me and you)
