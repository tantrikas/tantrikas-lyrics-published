# Thank You God

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
*Thank You, God*  
For Your blessings divine,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
For peace in my mind.  

*Thank You, God*  
For love thatâ€™s so true,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
For skies bright and blue.  

**[Verse 2]**  
*Thank You, God*  
For family and friends,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
Your grace never ends.  

*Thank You, God*  
For songs in my heart,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
Each dayâ€™s brand new start.  

**[Verse 3]**  
*Thank You, God*  
For strength when Iâ€™m weak,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
Your wisdom I seek.  

*Thank You, God*  
For the path when Iâ€™m lost,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
You carry the cost.  

**[Verse 4]**  
*Thank You, God*  
For mercy so deep,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
You wake me from sleep.  

*Thank You, God*  
For the bread, for the wine,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
Your promise is mine.  

**[Bridge â€“ Climax]** *(Music swells, vocals soar)*  
*"For every storm, You are my calm,  
Every wound, You are my balm!  
So Iâ€™ll sing it now, heaven hearsâ€”  
Thank You for turning my fears to cheers!"*  

**[Refrain â€“ Repeat & Fade]** *(Gentle, repetitive, meditative)*  
*Thank You, God*  
For time, for eternity,  
*Thank You, Thank You*  
Youâ€™ve set my heart freeâ€¦  

**(Outro: Soft ad-libs)**  
*"Thank Youâ€¦ (echoing)  
For being my start and my endâ€¦  
Thank Youâ€¦  
Amen."*
