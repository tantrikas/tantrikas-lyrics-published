# The Vision of Awakening

Not by faith  
Nor by words alone  
But by seeing the truth  
Within your own  

You’ll know these truths  
In threefold way  
To know  
To do  
To be  
Each day  

I saw the Truth  
Of Suffering clear  
I knew it must be  
Understood here  

I saw the Truth  
Of Cause appear  
I knew it must be  
Abandoned, dear  

I saw the Truth  
Of Ending near  
I knew it must  
Be realized, sheer  

I saw the Truth  
Of Path sincere  
I knew it must  
Be followed  
No fear  

Only when all  
Twelve lights aligned  
Did I awaken  
Beyond space and time  

Only then did I proclaim  
The deathless is found  
The unbinding flame
