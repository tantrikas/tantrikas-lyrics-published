# Flow_Prosperity Groove

## Lyrics

### Verse 1
My income is increasing every day...  
Like sunrise over debts they said I'd always pay... 
Like sunrise over debts they said I will maintain...  
Every "no" just turns to "yes" in golden ways...  
Blessings knockin' - I just smile and say "Okay..."

### Pre-Chorus
The math ain't mathin' (but the miracles do...)  
Bank app blinkin' (with a brand new view...)  
Now my gratitude's the currency I choose...

### Chorus (Big & Joyful)
ðŸ’° More every morning...  
ðŸ’° More when I'm sleep...  
ðŸ’° More when I give some away...  
ðŸ’° More every minute - watch it multiply...  
ðŸ’° The flow don't stop... it just finds me... (hey!)

### Verse 2
Same hustle - different decimal places...  
Now my tears turn to diamonds when they hit my face...  
Angel investors? Nah - ancestral grace...  
They prepared this feast - I'm just saying "Grace..."

### Bridge (Testimony Section)
**(Call & Response Ad-libs: "Say that!" / "It's shifting!")**  
Used to pray from lack... now I praise from stacks...  
Same God different math...  
Turned my scars into receipts...  
Every wound was just interest I was meant to reap...

### Chorus (Reprise - Full Choir)
ðŸ’° More every morning... *(more more more!)*  
ðŸ’° More when I'm sleep... *(while I rest!)*  
ðŸ’° More when I give some away... *(it comes back!)*  
ðŸ’° More every minute - watch it multiply...

### Outro (Whispered Affirmation)
*"My income is increasing...  
My joy is the interest...  
My worth is the principle...  
And baby... I'm compoundin'..."*

### Verse 3
Bank statements looking like a victory lap  
My mindset shifted, now abundance fills the gaps  
Every investment turns to harvest in my lap  
Divine provision - I just had to change my map
