# Forgiveness

## Lyrics

The instant you forgive  
your word is dissolved  
And the condition  
Is wiped out  

**Forgiveness is the great eraser**  
**Forgiveness is the great eraser**  
**Forgiveness is the great eraser**  

You cannot see clearly  
Until you have forgiven  
Forgiveness lifts the veil  
Of illusion  
And you see the perfect plan  
Unfolding  

Resentment, criticism  
And condemnation  
Are the killers of the soul  
They come from the belief  
In good and evil  

The tree of the knowledge  
Of good and evil  
Which Jesus Christ said  
Was the only thing  
That could harm you  

Drop these burdens now  
And walk free  
Drop these burdens now  
And walk free  
Drop these burdens now  
And walk free  
Drop these burdens now  
And walk free
