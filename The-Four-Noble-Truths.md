# 🎵 The Four Noble Truths

## ✨ Lyrics

**Then softly he spoke**  
The Fourfold Light  
The medicine for the  
World’s long night  

---

**First, he said**  
Understand this pain  
Birth, aging, death  
Loss, and gain  
Separation, longing  
Fleeting delight  
All is dukkha  
Shadows in light  

The five heaps we cling to,  
Body and mind,  
Are impermanent rivers  
To nothing confined.  

---

**Second, he said**  
The cause is known —  
Craving’s seed that  
We have sown.  
Thirst for pleasure,  
Thirst for becoming,  
Thirst for non-being,  
The wheel’s endless running.  

From craving’s fire  
Arises sorrow’s smoke,  
The chain of becoming  
Never broke.  

---

**Third, he said**  
The end can be —  
The flame goes out,  
The heart is free.  
When craving fades,  
All grasping ends,  
Peace unfolds  
Where nothing bends.  

This stillness is  
**Nibbāna’s shore**,  
Where birth and death  
Touch no more.  

---

**Fourth, he said**  
The path to cease  
Is the Noble Way —  
The road of peace.  
Follow the Eightfold Path sublime,  
And cross the river  
Beyond time.
