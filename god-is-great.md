### [Intro – Spoken/Meditative]  
*Om… Amen… Hallelujah… Namaste…*  
To the One who is without beginning or end.  
To the Light in all hearts, seen and unseen…

---

### [Verse 1]  
When the morning breaks through the silence,  
And the breath returns again,  
I see the hand that holds the stars,  
And feel the Love that knows no end.  

From every mountaintop and valley,  
To every soul that's lost and found—  
The Spirit moves in stillness deep,  
And speaks without a sound.

---

### [Chorus]  
**GOD is GREAT!** — In the rising of the sun.  
**GOD is GREAT!** — In the tears of everyone.  
From the desert sands to the city gates,  
Every heart can say:  
**GOD is GREAT!** — *Hallelujah, Om, Amen.*

---

### [Verse 2]  
You feed the hungry, heal the broken,  
Lift the fallen from the clay,  
You walk with those the world forgets—  
Your mercy lights their way.  

In every name and every nation,  
In every language, every tongue,  
The song of love, it rises up,  
The truth in everyone.

---

### [Bridge – Meditative/Chanted]  
*Om mani padme hum…*  
*Hallelujah…*  
*Shalom… Salaam…*  
*We are One… We are One…*  
*All children of the same Light.*

---

### [Chorus – Repeated with build-up]  
**GOD is GREAT!** — In the silence and the storm.  
**GOD is GREAT!** — In the child and the worn.  
From the prayer mats to cathedral gates,  
Every soul can say:  
**GOD is GREAT!** — *Om, Hallelujah, Amen.*

---

### [Verse 3 – Free-flow/spoken word over ambient music]  
When I kneel, when I fall, when I rise—  
You are there.  
In the cry for justice, in the gift of grace,  
In the trembling hands that care…  

The wise and the simple, the broken and healed,  
Each a spark of the flame eternal revealed.

---

### [Final Chorus – Gentle and universal]  
**GOD is GREAT!** — In the breath, in the flame.  
**GOD is GREAT!** — Every soul bears the Name.  
Not in fear, but in truth we proclaim:  
**GOD is GREAT!** — *Hallelujah… Om… Amen.*

---

### [Outro – Whispered/chant]  
*Om Shanti… Peace… Shalom… Amen…*  
*Love is the language… God is One.*
