# The Middle Way

Listen, O seekers  
Of peace and light  
There are two extremes  
That blind the sight  

One is the way 
Of pleasure’s chain  
Lost in senses 
Chasing gain  
That path is low  
It leads to pain  

The other the path 
Of thorns and fire  
Self-torment cloaked 
In holy attire  
Empty hunger  
Cold and dire  

Neither lust nor torture  
Can free the mind  
Avoid both O seekers  
The Middle Path you’ll find  

It opens the eye  
It opens the heart  
It leads to wisdom  
The end of dark  

Peace, insight  
And Nibbāna’s flame  
The Middle Way 
Is the noble name
