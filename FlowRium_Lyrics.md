# FlowRium

## Lyrics

### [Verse 1]
Something's changing in the air today  
Like colors dancing that I've never seen  
I close my eyes and feel the way  
To places no one else has been  

### [Pre-chorus]
And now I understand  
It's all within my hand  

### [Chorus]
I am flowing through the possible  
*(Through the possible, through the possible)*  
I am flowing through the possible  
Everything goes right for me  
Everything goes right, I see  

### [Verse 2]
Each morning brings a different light  
The walls around me seem to fade away  
My fingers trace the infinite  
As time becomes a child at play  

### [Pre-chorus]
And now I recognize  
The truth behind my eyes  

### [Chorus]
I am flowing through the possible  
*(Through the possible, through the possible)*  
I am flowing through the possible  
Everything goes right for me  
Everything goes right, I see  

### [Bridge]
**[Orchestral swell]**  
Look what I found inside...  
Look what was here all along...  
*(Ahhh-ahh-ahhh)*  

### [Breakdown]
Everything goes right for me now  
*(Right for me now, right for me)*  
Everything goes right for me now  
*(Opens endlessly)*  

### [Final Chorus]
I am flowing through the possible  
*(Through the possible, through the possible)*  
I am flowing through the possible  
Everything goes right for me  
Everything goes right, I see  

### [Outro]
Something's changing...  
*(Ahhh-ahh-ahhh)*
