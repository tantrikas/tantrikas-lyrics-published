# Rich Vibe

## Lyrics

Got smth to tell u  
Got to tell u  
Just checked my bank app on  
Can't believe what I see  
Send u a screenshot quick  
Look what's happening to me  
Like ur energy pulls me in  
Can't resist this vibe we're in  
Everything I touch turns bright  
Watch it multiply tonight  

When u know what ur worth - ayy  
Let it flow through the earth - ayy  
Everything comes back to me  
Like a force naturally  
Let it flow, let it flow  
Let it flow, let it flow  

Got another notification  
Bank app lighting up again  
Think the universe heard me  
When I said - watch this win  

Ahhh ahhh  
What u got? - Abundance  
What u bring? - That finance  
How u move? - With power  
What's ur gift? - This hour  

When u know what ur worth - ayy  
Let it flow through the earth - ayy  
Everything comes back to me  
Like a force naturally  
Let it flow, let it flow  
Let it flow, let it flow  

Keep that energy  
Count your blessings  
Keep that energy coming through  

When u know what ur worth - ayy  
Let it flow through the earth - ayy  
Everything comes back to me  
Like a force naturally  
Let it flow, let it flow  
Let it flow, let it flow  

Keep that energy  
Count your blessings  
Keep that energy coming through  

Keep that energy  
Count your blessings  
Keep that energy coming through  

When u know what ur worth - ayy  
Let it flow through the earth - ayy  
Everything comes back to me  
Like a force naturally  
Let it flow, let it flow  
Let it flow, let it flow  

Keep that energy  
Count your blessings  
Keep that energy coming through
