### Lyrics  

*(Intro – Instrumental: Tibetan flute, soft drone strings, heartbeat drum)*  

**Verse 1 – Opening Insight**  
Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva,  
when practicing deeply  
the Prajñāpāramitā,  
clearly saw that all five aggregates are empty  
and thus relieved all suffering.  

*(brief instrumental pause – echo of flute)*  

**Verse 2 – The Emptiness of Form**  
Shariputra,  
form is emptiness,  
emptiness is form;  
form does not differ from emptiness,  
and emptiness does not differ from form.  
The same is true for feelings,  
perceptions,  
formations,  
and consciousness.  

*(string swell, breathy pause)*  

**Verse 3 – The Nature of Phenomena**  
Shariputra,  
all phenomena are marked with emptiness:  
they are neither born nor destroyed,  
neither stained nor pure,  
neither increase nor decrease.  

**Verse 4 – The Emptiness of Perception**  
Therefore, in emptiness,  
no form,  
no feelings,  
no perceptions,  
no mental formations,  
no consciousness;  
no eyes,  
no ears,  
no nose,  
no tongue,  
no body,  
no mind;  
no sights,  
no sounds,  
no smells,  
no tastes,  
no touch,  
no objects of mind;  
no realm of sight,  
no realm of mind consciousness.  

*(flute and strings interlude – soft drumming enters)*  

**Verse 5 – No Ignorance, No Suffering**  
There is no ignorance  
and no end to ignorance,  
no old age and death,  
and no end to old age and death.  
No suffering,  
no cause of suffering,  
no cessation of suffering,  
and no path.  
No wisdom  
and no attainment.  

*(slow pause – whisper vocals layering in harmony)*  

**Verse 6 – The Bodhisattva Path**  
Because there is no attainment,  
the bodhisattva relies on Prajñāpāramitā,  
and the mind is no hindrance.  
Without hindrance,  
there is no fear.  
Far beyond all inverted views,  
one realizes Nirvana.  

**Verse 7 – Enlightenment**  
All Buddhas of the past,  
present,  
and future  
rely on Prajñāpāramitā  
and thereby attain  
supreme, complete enlightenment.  

*(deep base note rise – strings shimmer softly)*  

**Verse 8 – The Mantra**  
Therefore, know that Prajñāpāramitā  
is the great miraculous mantra,  
the great bright mantra,  
the supreme mantra,  
the incomparable mantra,  
which removes all suffering  
and is true, not false.  

*(gentle drum crescendo, breath held)*  

**Verse 9 – The Mantra (Chant)**  
Therefore, we proclaim  
the Prajñāpāramitā mantra:  
*Gate gate*  
*pāragate*  
*pārasamgate*
