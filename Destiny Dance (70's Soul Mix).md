**[Verse 1]**  
Something's shifting in the sky tonight  
Like patterns playing through prisms of light  
I feel my feet leaving solid ground  
While melodies move me round and round  
What happens when the world opens wide?  
When every path leads to paradise?

---

**[Chorus]**  
Dancing with destiny, light as the breeze  
Finding the future in moments like these

---

**[Verse 2]**  
Morning sunbeams paint perfect days  
As time twirls and turns in wonderful ways  
My mind's moving through magical scenes  
And life's lifting me beyond what it seems  
I'm floating free through fields of chance  
While stars and sunlight spark and dance

---

**[Chorus]**  
Dancing with destiny, light as the breeze  
Finding the future in moments like these

---

**[Bridge]**  
Possibilities pour like summer rain  
Painting pictures I can't explain  
Every direction leads me right  
Through this beautiful, boundless night

---

**[Solo]**  
*Saxophone and violin interweave*  
*Piano cascades*  
*Guitar harmonics float*

---

**[Chorus]**  
Dancing with destiny, light as the breeze  
Finding the future in moments like these

---

**[Outro]**  
(La la la, floating free)  
(Everything's right with me)  
*Violin fades*  
*Final piano notes dissolve*
