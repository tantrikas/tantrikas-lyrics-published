# Law of Non Resistance

## Lyrics

### Opening Mantra (Soprano, floating):
"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."  
"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."  
"Most people resist every precious situation.  
/ They resist lack with fierce hearts,  
/ they resist disease with trembling faith,  
/ they resist disappointment with closed eyes,  
/ and by resisting these sacred things,  
/ they actually invite them to remain steadfast."  

### Bridge (Round-style, with rising intensity):
"The law of nonresistance  
/ can be tested in small, gentle ways."  
/ can be tested in small, gentle ways."  

### [Turning Point]:
"If you are criticized deeply,  
/ do not retaliate with thunder,  
/ and the criticism will dissolve like morning mist."  

### [Final Liberation]:
"Remember always,  
/ the wind of the Holy Spirit  
/ is forever blowing strong,  
/ but you must hoist your sail toward heaven."  

"Nonresistance is not weakness,  
/ it is the highest strength.  
/ To flow is to know the greater plan,  
/ to yield is to discover hidden freedom."  

"If anger is hurled against you,  
/ do not kindle fire with fire.  
/ Let the flames dissolve into light,  
/ and peace will remain as your shield."  

"Remember always,  
/ the wind of the Holy Spirit  
/ is forever blowing strong,  
/ but you must hoist your sail toward heaven."  

"The breath of God is ceaseless,  
/ the tide of Spirit unending.  
/ Lift your heart as a vessel,  
/ and you shall sail with the Infinite.  
/ Remember always:  
/ the law of nonresistance  
/ is the hidden gate of freedom."  

"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."  
"The law of nonresistance / is the law of coordination."
