# Shake the Something

### Description
“Shake the Something” is a playful, surreal funk anthem that celebrates the joy of movement without meaning. It’s a rhythmic rebellion against overthinking — a dance of nonsense, neon dreams, and pure groove. Every line twists logic into music, inviting you to surrender to rhythm and laugh with your own reflection. Think cosmic humor meets deep funk — a sonic cartoon of freedom and fun.

### Lyrics

**(Intro – whispered groove)**  
Oh yeah…  
Get up, get out, get down to the up now…  
Mmm, funky static in my coffee cup, what?  

**(Verse 1)**  
Banana in a briefcase, moonwalk in my shoes,  
Fuzzy elevator going straight to the groove,  
Rainbow in a teacup, sugar on the sun,  
My feet don’t care — they already begun!  

**(Pre-Chorus)**  
Twist that noodle, spin that vibe,  
Tickle the beat till the bass comes alive,  
Nobody knows what I just said —  
But your hips already went ahead!  

**(Chorus)**  
Shake the something!  
Move that nothing!  
Slide to the left with a yeah-yeah-yeah!  
Pop that bubble, double trouble,  
Dance like words don’t mean a thing!  

**(Verse 2)**  
Electric pancake talking to my knees,  
Got a saxophone breeze in the lemon trees,  
I’m fluent in rhythm, I don’t need a plan,  
Just clap with your toes if you really can!  

**(Bridge)**  
Ooh, cosmic jelly on my stereo plate,  
Got the groove so smooth it’s a full-on debate,  
Tell the mirror, “Hey, you look absurd!”  
Mirror says, “Baby, I second that word!”  

**(Chorus)**  
Shake the something!  
Move that nothing!  
Slide to the right with a wow-wow-wow!  
Pop that bubble, trouble double,  
Talk to the beat — it’s listening now!  

**(Breakdown – spoken funk)**  
Hey! Who turned off the logic?  
Bring back the nonsense!  
Somebody say “oh!”  
Everybody say “mmm, why not?”  

**(Final Chorus / Outro)**  
Shake the something!  
Move that nothing!  
Spin till the daylight calls your name!  
Snap that thunder, feel that wonder,  
We all groove just the same!  

**(Repeat, fade, ad-libs, and shouts)**  
— “Funky static!”  
— “Banana briefcase!”  
— “Tell the mirror, yeah!”
