# Midnight Grace

---

### Intro  
*(Mmm, ohhh, ohâ€”)*  
*[Soft angelic vocals over light piano, horns hum]*

---

### Verse 1  
These pews hold the echoes of every tear I laid down,  
Midnight air is thick with all I tried to outrun.  
With hands clenched, I cross myselfâ€”too heavy to explain  
But something stirs the shadows, a hush before the dawn.

---

### Verse 2  
Keys and horns rising, my heart starts to sway,  
Soft candle flickers, comforting my trembling spine.  
Inside me, the weight loosensâ€”I hear the silent refrain,  
Midnight struck, and grace came calling my name.

---

### Solo  
*[Saxophone leads, horns shimmer, piano ripples]*

---

### Verse 3  
Bitterness crept in slow, wrote its lines upon my soul,  
Voice trembling, I reach for a mercy I canâ€™t see.  
Every stained window alive with the heat of old regrets,  
Yet thereâ€™s a warmth growing, music circling over me.

---

### Chorus  
*(I call on the law of forgiveness,)*  
I breathe out my faults beneath this midnight sky;  
I am lifted, I am mendedâ€”  
No longer asking why.

---

### Solo  
*[Horn section swells, wordless vocalations, saxophone cries]*

---

### Verse 4  
Iâ€™m dancing nowâ€”barefoot on smooth worn floor,  
Under hush of grace, I let go the ache of the past.  
Footsteps echo freedomâ€”every scar I carried before,  
Tonight, I am free. This forgiveness will last.

---

### Bridge  
*(Sing low, oh angels, sing light on my skin,)*  
With every note, I am more than I have been.  
Lay down the old lawâ€”all those debts and dues,  
I walk out in silence, embraced by something new.

---

### Outro  
*[Horn shimmer, gentle piano]*  
**Midnight struck, and grace came calling my name.**
