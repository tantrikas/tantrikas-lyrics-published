## No More Masquerade

---
## Lyrics & Arrangement

**Intro – Instrumental (0:00–0:24)**  
Soft guitar intro (warm jazz tone) with light keys and bass.  
Hint at chorus melody instrumentally.

**Verse 1 (0:25–1:04)** *(voice gentle, conversational)*  
We talk all night but never say  
The things we’re both afraid to face.  
We laugh, we smile, we play the part,  
But walls are growing in our hearts.  
It’s like we’re dancing in disguise,  
Hiding the truth from each other’s eyes.

**Pre-Chorus (1:05–1:18)** *(slight lift in tone)*  
I can’t keep living in this game,  
Chasing a love that has no name.

**Chorus (1:19–1:47)** *(full, warm vocal; let each line breathe)*  
No more masquerade — I’m letting it go,  
The lies we’ve learned, the things we don’t show.  
I want the real you, I’ll give you the real me,  
Not the shadows we pretend to be.  
When the masks are gone and the fear has strayed,  
We’ll see the truth — no more masquerade.

**Instrumental Fill (1:48–2:08)**  
Guitar or sax solo echoes the chorus melody.  
Keep tempo steady, mellow groove.

**Verse 2 (2:09–2:48)** *(slightly stronger delivery)*  
We’ve built our dreams on shifting ground,  
Afraid the real thing won’t be found.  
We talk of love like it’s a play,  
But the curtain’s falling anyway.  
Maybe the truth’s been here all along,  
Waiting for us to come home where we belong.

**Pre-Chorus (2:49–3:02)** *(same as first but a touch more urgency)*  
If we could only drop the show,  
We might see more than we could ever know.

**Chorus – Double (3:03–3:44)** *(first round normal, second round with ad-libs)*  
No more masquerade — I’m letting it go,  
The lies we’ve learned, the things we don’t show.  
I want the real you, I’ll give you the real me,  
Not the shadows we pretend to be.  
When the masks are gone and the fear has strayed,  
We’ll see the truth — no more masquerade.  
*(ad-libs: “No more hiding… no more shade…”)*

**Bridge (3:45–4:08)** *(softer, like a late-night confession)*  
Past the illusions, past the pain,  
There’s only love — it’s always been the same.  
One step closer, one heart unafraid,  
One world beyond the masquerade.

**Chorus – Final (4:09–4:35)** *(slightly slower, more open)*  
No more masquerade — I’m letting it go,  
The lies we’ve learned, the things we don’t show.  
I want the real you, I’ll give you the real me…

**Outro – Instrumental Fade (4:36–5:05)**  
Gentle guitar improvisation over final chorus chords.  
Fade on the line *(softly spoken)*: “No more masquerade…”
