### 🎧 Intro *(Whispered power, sub-bass drops, synth hums)*  
**"I... AM..."**  
*(Beat slams—sudden silence, then:)*

### 🎤 Verse 1 *(Smooth, confident flow over pulsing bass)*  
I am whole—no cracks in my foundation,  
I am perfect—He wrote my declaration.  
I am strong—like a river breaking levees,  
I am power—lightning in my Jesus! (Yah!)

---

### 🔊 Pre-Chorus *(Chopped vocal samples, rising energy)*  
Doubt tried to name me, (Nah!)  
Shame tried to claim me, (Nah!)  
But I know what God says—  
So I'm screaming it louder!

### 🎤 Verse 2 *(Swaggering triplet flow)*  
I am love—overflow like a fountain,  
I am harmony—sky-high with the mountains.  
I am joy—laughing in the struggle,  
I am victory—devil's in trouble! (Ohhh!)
