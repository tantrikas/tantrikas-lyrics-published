# Gratitude

## Lyrics

Thank You, God  
For Your blessings divine  
Thank You, Thank You  
For peace in my mind  

Thank You, God  
For love that’s so true  
Thank You, Thank You  
For skies bright and blue  

Thank You, God  
For family and friends  
Thank You, Thank You  
Your grace never ends  

Thank You, God  
For songs in my heart  
Thank You, Thank You  
Each day’s brand new start  

Thank You, God  
For strength when I’m weak  
Thank You, Thank You  
Your wisdom I seek  

Thank You, God  
For the path when I’m lost  
Thank You, Thank You  
You carry the cost  

Thank You, God  
For mercy so deep  
Thank You, Thank You  
You wake me from sleep  

Thank You, God  
For the bread, for the wine  
Thank You, Thank You  
Your promise is mine  

For every storm, You are my calm  
Every wound, You are my balm  
So I’ll sing it now, heaven hears  
Thank You for turning my fears to cheers  

Thank You, God  
For time, for eternity  
Thank You, Thank You  
You’ve set my heart free  

Thank You  
For being my start and my end  
Thank You  
Amen
