# ðŸŽ¶ By Thy Words - Funky Smooth Mix

## Lyrics

### (Intro / Drop Tease)
Say it loud, say it true â€”  
Every wordâ€™s coming back to you...  
Yeah, yeah!  
(*drop*)

### (Verse 1)
Words like bullets, words like gold,  
Speak it hot or speak it cold.  
Every lineâ€™s a little spell â€”  
Lift it up or drop to hell.

### (Pre-Chorus)
You talk it, you walk it,  
You plant it, you rock it â€”  
Every word's got roots,  
So bless that socket.

### (Chorus / Hook)
By thy words â€” justified!  
By thy words â€” amplified!  
Say it right, make it fly â€”  
Your tongueâ€™s got wings, now testify!  
(*repeat*)

### (Breakdown / Spoken)
What you say is what you grow...  
Truth, lies, highs, lows â€”  
Speak in love â€” and watch it glow.  
(*bass re-drop*)

### (Bridge - Club Chant Style)
Speak it sweet â€” you vibe elite.  
Talk that light â€” move your feet!  
No hate, no fear â€”  
Just blessings in your atmosphere!

### (Chorus / Hook â€“ repeat with buildup)
By thy words â€” justified!  
By thy words â€” electrified!  
Say it real, say it bold,  
Your mouthâ€™s the magic, strike that gold!
