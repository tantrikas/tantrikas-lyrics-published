# Money and Riches  

## 🪙 Lyrics

I feel rich  
Wealth flows to me  
Prosperity surrounds me  
I open up my heart  
I open up my mind  
Abundance is my essence  
There's more than enough to find  

Every thought a seed of gold  
Every breath a gift divine  
I'm calling in the riches  
I let my spirit shine  

The universe provides me  
With endless love and care  
My path to wealth expands  
With every single prayer  

My focus is a beacon  
Drawing fortune close to me  
I'm tuning in to  
Limitless prosperity  

The gates of wealth swing wide  
Inviting me within  
A new chapter of abundance  
Ready to begin  

I am rich  
I feel rich  
My soul aligned  
My heart uplifted  

Money and riches  
I start to accumulate  
Wealth speeds up  
It resonates  

I am rich  
I feel rich  
My thoughts in flow  
My life unlimited  

Simply focusing on  
Being rich  
And I become it  
I become it  

Blessed and grateful  
I receive  
Everything I can conceive  

I see the doors swing open  
I see the pathways clear  
Every opportunity  
Every blessing I revere  

Gratitude in every moment  
Gratitude sets me free  
I claim success and plenty  
I welcome my victory  

The seeds of wealth are planted  
Deep within my soul  
Each day brings new abundance  
Making my life whole  

My focus is a magnet  
Pulling abundance near  
I trust the law of giving  
Receiving without fear  

Divine timing guides me  
To prosperity's embrace  
As blessings flow towards me  
With perfect grace  

Om… abundant universe  
Hear my call  
Namaste to riches  
I welcome them all  

Hallelujah to blessings  
Hallelujah to grace  
I stand in my power  
I stand in this place  

Sacred wealth flows  
Through my veins  
Infinite abundance  
Now remains  

Divine prosperity shows the way  
As I embrace this blessed day  

I attract wealth  
Wealth speeds up  
To become me  

I am wealth  
I am success  
Abundance flows naturally  

Every breath brings  
More prosperity  

Wealth flows  
Wealth grows  
I am rich  
I become rich  

Success flows  
Love grows  
I am blessed  
I am prosperous
